<p><span class="bold">LEFEBVRE, TANNEGUY<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Tanaquillus Faber</span>) (1615-1672),
French classical scholar, was born at Caen. After completing
his studies in Paris, he was appointed by Cardinal Richelieu
inspector of the printing-press at the Louvre. After Richelieu&rsquo;s
death he left Paris, joined the Reformed Church, and in 1651
obtained a professorship at the academy of Saumur, which he
filled with great success for nearly twenty years. His increasing
ill-health and a certain moral laxity (as shown in his judgment
on Sappho) led to a quarrel with the consistory, as a result of
which he resigned his professorship. Several universities were
eager to obtain his services, and he had accepted a post offered
him by the elector palatine at Heidelberg, when he died suddenly
on the 12th of September, 1672. One of his children was the
famous Madame Dacier. Lefebvre, who was by no means a
typical student in dress or manners, was a highly cultivated
man and a thorough classical scholar. He brought out editions
of various Greek and Latin authors&mdash;Longinus, Anacreon and
Sappho, Virgil, Horace, Lucretius and many others. His
most important original works are: <i>Les Vies des poètes Grecs</i>
(1665); <i>Méthode pour commencer les humanités Grecques et
Latines</i> (2nd ed., 1731), of which several English adaptations
have appeared; <i>Epistolae Criticae</i> (1659).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEFEBVRE-DESNOËTTES, CHARLES,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> <span class="sc">Comte</span> (1773-1822),
French cavalry general, joined the army in 1792 and served with
the armies of the North, of the Sambre-and-Meuse and Rhine-and-Moselle
in the various campaigns of the Revolution. Six
years later he had become captain and aide-de-camp to General
Bonaparte. At Marengo he won further promotion, and at
Austerlitz became colonel, serving also in the Prussian campaigns
of 1806-1807. In 1808 he was made general of brigade and
created a count of the Empire. Sent with the army into Spain,
he conducted the first and unsuccessful siege of Saragossa.
The battlefield of Tudela showed his talents to better advantage,
but towards the end of 1808 he was taken prisoner in the action
of Benavente by the British cavalry under Paget (later Lord
Uxbridge, and subsequently Marquis of Anglesey). For over two
years he remained a prisoner in England, living on parole at
Cheltenham. In 1811 he escaped, and in the invasion of Russia
in 1812 was again at the head of his cavalry. In 1813 and 1814
his men distinguished themselves in most of the great battles,
especially La Rothière and Montmirail. He joined Napoleon in
the Hundred Days and was wounded at Waterloo. For his
part in these events he was condemned to death, but he escaped
to the United States, and spent the next few years farming in
Louisiana. His frequent appeals to Louis XVIII. eventually
obtained his permission to return, but the &ldquo;Albion,&rdquo; the vessel
on which he was returning to France, went down off the coast of
Ireland with all on board on the 22nd of May 1822.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE FÈVRE, JEAN<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1395-1468), Burgundian chronicler and
seigneur of Saint Remy, is also known as Toison d&rsquo;or from his
long connexion with the order of the Golden Fleece. Of noble
birth, he adopted the profession of arms and with other Burgundians
fought in the English ranks at Agincourt. In 1430,
on the foundation of the order of the Golden Fleece by Philip III.
the Good, duke of Burgundy, Le Fèvre was appointed its king
of arms and he soon became a very influential person at the
Burgundian court. He frequently assisted Philip in conducting
negotiations with foreign powers, and he was an arbiter in
tournaments and on all questions of chivalry, where his wide
knowledge of heraldry was highly useful. He died at Bruges
on the 16th of June 1468.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Le Fèvre wrote a <i>Chronique</i>, or <i>Histoire de Charles VI., roy de
France</i>. The greater part of this chronicle is merely a copy of the
work of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, but Le Fèvre is an original
authority for the years between 1428 and 1436 and makes some
valuable additions to our knowledge, especially about the chivalry
of the Burgundian court. He is more concise than Monstrelet, but
is equally partial to the dukes of Burgundy. The <i>Chronique</i> has
been edited by F. Morand for the Société de l&rsquo;histoire de France
(Paris, 1876). Le Fèvre is usually regarded as the author of the
<i>Livre des faites de Jacques de Lalaing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEG<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (a word of Scandinavian origin, from the Old Norwegian
<i>leggr</i>, cf. Swed. <i>lägg</i>, Dan. <i>laég</i>; the O. Eng. word was <i>sceanca</i>,
shank), the general name for those limbs in animals which
support and move the body, and in man for the lower limbs of
the body (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Anatomy</a></span>, <i>Superficial and Artistic</i>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Skeleton</a></span>,
<i>Appendicular</i>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Muscular System</a></span>). The word is in common
use for many objects which resemble the leg in shape or function.
As a slang term, &ldquo;leg,&rdquo; a shortened form of &ldquo;blackleg,&rdquo; has
been in use since the end of the 18th century for a swindler,
especially in connexion with racing or gambling. The term
&ldquo;blackleg&rdquo; is now also applied by trade-unionists to a workman
who, during a strike or lockout, continues working or is brought
to take the place of the withdrawn workers.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEGACY<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> (Lat. <i>legatum</i>), in English law, some particular thing
or things given or left by a testator in his will, to be paid or
performed by his executor or administrator. The word is
primarily applicable to gifts of personalty or gifts charged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
upon real estate; but if there is nothing else to which it can
refer it may refer to realty; the proper word, however, for gifts
of realty is <i>devise</i>.</p>

<p>Legacies may be either specific, general or demonstrative.
A <i>specific legacy</i> is &ldquo;something which a testator, identifying it
by a sufficient description and manifesting an intention that it
should be enjoyed in the state and condition indicated by that
description, separates in favour of a particular legatee from the
general mass of his personal estate,&rdquo; <i>e.g.</i> a gift of &ldquo;my portrait
by X,&rdquo; naming the artist. A <i>general legacy</i> is a gift not so
distinguished from the general mass of the personal estate, <i>e.g.</i>
a gift of £100 or of a gold ring. A <i>demonstrative legacy</i> partakes
of the nature of both the preceding kinds of legacies, <i>e.g.</i> a gift
of £100 payable out of a named fund is a specific legacy so far
as the fund named is available to pay the legacy; after the fund
is exhausted the balance of the legacy is a general legacy and
recourse must be had to the general estate to satisfy such
balance. Sometimes a testator bequeaths two or more legacies
to the same person; in such a case it is a question whether the
later legacies are in substitution for, or in addition to, the earlier
ones. In the latter case they are known as <i>cumulative</i>. In each
case the intention of the testator is the rule of construction;
this can often be gathered from the terms of the will or codicil,
but in the absence of such evidence the following rules are
followed by the courts. Where the same specific thing is bequeathed
twice to the same legatee or where two legacies of equal
amount are bequeathed by the same instrument the second
bequest is mere repetition; but where legacies of equal amounts
are bequeathed by different instruments or of unequal amounts
by the same instruments they are considered to be cumulative.</p>

<p>If the estate of the testator is insufficient to satisfy all the
legacies these must abate, <i>i.e.</i> be reduced rateably; as to this
it should be noticed that specific and demonstrative legacies have
a prior claim to be paid in full out of the specific fund before
general legacies, and that general legacies abate rateably <i>inter se</i>
in the absence of any provision to the contrary by the testator.
Specific legacies are liable to ademption where the specific thing
perishes or ceases to belong to the testator, <i>e.g.</i> in the instance
given above if the testator sells the portrait the legatee will get
nothing by virtue of the legacy. As a general rule, legacies
given to persons who predecease the testator do not take effect;
they are said to lapse. This is so even if the gift be to A and his
executors, administrators and assigns, but this is not so if the
testator has shown a contrary intention, thus, a gift to A <i>or</i> his
personal representative will be effective even though A predecease
the testator; further, by the Wills Act 1837, devises of estates
tail and gifts to a child or other issue of the testator will not
lapse if any issue of the legatee survive the testator. Lapsed
legacies fall into and form part of the residuary estate. In the
absence of any indication to the contrary a legacy becomes due
on the day of the death of the testator, though for the convenience
of the executor it is not payable till a year after that date; this
delay does not prevent the legacy vesting on the testator&rsquo;s
death. It frequently happens, however, that a legacy is given
payable at a future date; in such a case, if the legatee dies after
the testator but prior to the date when the legacy is payable
it is necessary to discover whether the legacy was vested or
contingent, as in the former case it becomes payable to the
legatee&rsquo;s representative; in the latter, it lapses. In this, as in
other cases, the test is the intention of the testator as expressed
in the will; generally it may be said that a gift &ldquo;payable&rdquo;
or &ldquo;to be paid&rdquo; at a certain fixed time confers a vested interest
on the legatee, while a gift to A &ldquo;at&rdquo; a fixed time, <i>e.g.</i> twenty-one
years of age, only confers on A an interest contingent on his
attaining the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p><i>Legacy Duty</i> is a duty charged by the state upon personal property
devolving upon the legatees or next of kin of a dead person,
either by virtue of his will or upon his intestacy. The duty was
first imposed in England in 1780, but the principal act dealing with
the subject is the Legacy Duty Act 1796. The principal points as
to the duty are these. The duty is charged on personalty only.
It is payable only where the person on whose death the property
passes was domiciled in the United Kingdom. The rate of duty
varies from 1 to 10% according to the relationship between the
testator and legatee. As between husband and wife no duty
is payable. The duty is payable by the executors and deducted
from the legacy unless the testator directs otherwise. Special
provisions as to valuation are in force where the gift is of an
annuity or is settled on various persons in succession, or the
legacy is given in joint tenancy and other cases. In some cases the
duty is payable by instalments which carry interest at 3%.
In various cases legacies are exempt from duty&mdash;the more important
are gifts to a member of the royal family, specific
legacies under £20 (pecuniary legacies under £20 pay duty),
legacies of books, prints, &amp;c., given to a body corporate for
preservation, not for sale, and legacies given out of an estate
the principal value of which is less than £100. Further, by the
Finance Act 1894, payment of the estate duty thereby created
absorbs the 1% duty paid by lineal ancestors or descendants of
the deceased<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and the duty on a settled legacy, and, lastly, in
the event of estate duty being paid on an estate the total value
of which is under £1000, no legacy duty is payable. The legacy
duty payable in Ireland is now for all practical purposes assimilated
to that in Great Britain. The principal statute in that
country is an act of 1814.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1a" id="ft1a" href="#fa1a"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The Finance Bill 1909-1910 re-imposed this duty, and extended
it to husbands and wives as well as descendants and ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE GALLIENNE, RICHARD<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (1866-&emsp;&emsp;), English poet and
critic, was born in Liverpool on the 20th of January 1866. He
started life in a business office in Liverpool, but abandoned this
to turn author. <i>My Lady&rsquo;s Sonnets</i> appeared at Liverpool in
1887, and in 1889 he became for a short time literary secretary
to Wilson Barrett. In the same year he published <i>Volumes in
Folio</i>, <i>The Book Bills</i> of Narcissus and <i>George Meredith: some
Characteristics</i> (new ed., 1900). He joined the staff of the <i>Star</i>
in 1891, and wrote for various papers over the signature of
&ldquo;Logroller.&rdquo; <i>English Poems</i> (1892), <i>R. L. Stevenson and other
Poems</i> (1895), a paraphrase (1897) of the <i>Rubáiyát</i> of Omar
Khayyám, and <i>Odes from the Divan of Hafiz</i> (1903), contained
some light, graceful verse, but he is best known by the fantastic

<i>Sleeping Beauty and other Prose Fancies</i> (1900), <i>The Religion
of a Literary Man</i> (1893), <i>The Quest of the Golden Girl</i> (1897),
<i>The Life Romantic</i> (1901), &amp;c. His first wife, Mildred Lee, died
in 1894, and in 1897 he married Julie Norregard, subsequently
taking up his residence in the United States. In 1906 he translated,
from the Danish, Peter Nansen&rsquo;s <i>Love&rsquo;s Trilogy</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGARÉ, HUGH SWINTON<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (1797-1843), American lawyer
and statesman, was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on the
2nd of January 1797, of Huguenot and Scotch stock. Partly
on account of his inability to share in the amusements of his
fellows by reason of a deformity due to vaccine poisoning before
he was five (the poison permanently arresting the growth and
development of his legs), he was an eager student, and in 1814
he graduated at the College of South Carolina with the highest
rank in his class and with a reputation throughout the state for
scholarship and eloquence. He studied law for three years in
South Carolina, and then spent two years abroad, studying
French and Italian in Paris and jurisprudence at Edinburgh.
In 1820-1822 and in 1824-1830 he was a member of the South
Carolina legislature. In 1827, with Stephen Elliott (1771-1830),
the naturalist, he founded the <i>Southern Review</i>, of which he was
the sole editor after Elliott&rsquo;s death until 1834, when it was
discontinued, and to which he contributed articles on law,
travel, and modern and classical literature. In 1830-1832 he
was attorney-general of South Carolina, and, although a State&rsquo;s
Rights man, he strongly opposed nullification. During his
term of office he appeared in a case before the United States
Supreme Court, where his knowledge of civil law so strongly
impressed Edward Livingston, the secretary of state, who was
himself an admirer of Roman Law, that he urged Legaré to
devote himself to the study of this subject with the hope that he
might influence American law toward the spirit and philosophy
and even the forms and processes of Roman jurisprudence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>
Through Livingston, Legaré was appointed American <i>chargé
d&rsquo;affaires</i> at Brussels, where from 1833 to 1836 he perfected
himself in civil law and in the German commentaries on civil
law. In 1837-1839, as a Union Democrat, he was a member of
the national House of Representatives, and there ably opposed
Van Buren&rsquo;s financial policy in spite of the enthusiasm in South
Carolina for the sub-treasury project. He supported Harrison
in the presidential campaign of 1840, and when the cabinet was
reconstructed by Tyler in 1841, Legaré was appointed attorney-general
of the United States. On the 9th of May 1843 he was
appointed secretary of state <i>ad interim</i>, after the resignation of
Daniel Webster. On the 20th of June 1843 he died suddenly at
Boston. His great work, the forcing into common law of the
principles of civil law, was unaccomplished; but Story says &ldquo;he
seemed about to accomplish [it]; for his arguments before the
Supreme Court were crowded with the principles of the Roman
Law, wrought into the texture of the Common Law with great
success.&rdquo; As attorney-general he argued the famous cases, the
<i>United States</i> v. <i>Miranda</i>, <i>Wood</i> v. <i>the United States</i>, and
<i>Jewell</i> v. <i>Jewell</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGAS,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> one of the Shangalla group of tribes, regarded as among
the purest types of the Galla race. They occupy the upper
Yabus valley, S.W. Abyssinia, near the Sudan frontier. The
Legas are physically distinct from the Negro Shangalla. They
are of very light complexion, tall and thin, with narrow hollow-cheeked
faces, small heads and high foreheads. The chiefs&rsquo;
families are of more mixed blood, with perceptible Negro strain.
The Legas are estimated to number upwards of a hundred
thousand, of whom some 20,000 are warriors. They are, however,
a peaceful race, kind to their women and slaves, and energetic
agriculturists. Formerly independent, they came about 1900
under the sway of Abyssinia. The Legas are pagans, but Mahommedanism
has gained many converts among them.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGATE, BARTHOLOMEW<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1575-1612), English fanatic,
was born in Essex and became a dealer in cloth. About the
beginning of the 17th century he became a preacher among a sect
called the &ldquo;Seekers,&rdquo; and appears to have held unorthodox
opinions about the divinity of Jesus Christ. Together with his
brother Thomas he was put in prison for heresy in 1611. Thomas
died in Newgate gaol, London, but Bartholomew&rsquo;s imprisonment
was not a rigorous one. James I. argued with him, and on
several occasions he was brought before the Consistory Court of
London, but without any definite result. Eventually, after
having threatened to bring an action for wrongful imprisonment,
Legate was tried before a full Consistory Court in February 1612,
was found guilty of heresy, and was delivered to the secular
authorities for punishment. Refusing to retract his opinions
he was burned to death at Smithfield on the 18th of March 1612.
Legate was the last person burned in London for his religious
opinions, and Edward Wightman, who was burned at Lichfield
in April 1612, was the last to suffer in this way in England.</p>

under the title &ldquo;De officio legati&rdquo; the canon law recognizes two
sorts of legate, the <i>legatus natus</i> and the <i>legatus datus</i> or <i>missus</i>.
The <i>legatus datus</i> (<i>missus</i>) may be either (1) <i>delegatus</i>, or (2)
<i>nuncius apostolicus</i>, or (3) <i>legatus a latere</i> (<i>lateralis, collateralis</i>).
The rights of the <i>legatus natus</i>, which included concurrent jurisdiction
with that of all the bishops within his province, have
been much curtailed since the 16th century; they were altogether
suspended in presence of the higher claims of a <i>legatus
a latere</i>, and the title is now almost quite honorary. It was
attached to the see of Canterbury till the Reformation and it
still attaches to the sees of Seville, Toledo, Aries, Reims, Lyons,
Gran, Prague, Gnesen-Posen, Cologne, Salzburg, among others.
The commission of the <i>legatus delegatus</i> (generally a member
of the local clergy) is of a limited nature, and relates only to
some definite piece of work. The <i>nuncius apostolicus</i> (who has
the privilege of red apparel, a white horse and golden spurs)
possesses ordinary jurisdiction within the province to which he
has been sent, but his powers otherwise are restricted by the terms
of his mandate. The <i>legatus a latere</i> (almost invariably a cardinal,
though the power can be conferred on other prelates) is in the
fullest sense the plenipotentiary representative of the pope, and
possesses the high prerogative implied in the words of Gregory
VII., &ldquo;nostra vice quae corrigenda sunt corrigat, quae statuend
constituat.&rdquo; He has the power of suspending all the bishops in
his province, and no judicial cases are reserved from his judgment.
Without special mandate, however, he cannot depose
bishops or unite or separate bishoprics. At present <i>legati a
latere</i> are not sent by the holy see, but diplomatic relations,
where they exist, are maintained by means of nuncios, internuncios
and other agents.</p>

<p>The history of the office of papal legate is closely involved with
that of the papacy itself. If it were proved that papal legates
exercised the prerogatives of the primacy in the early councils,
it would be one of the strongest points for the Roman Catholic
view of the papal history. Thus it is claimed that Hosius of
Cordova presided over the council of Nicaea (325) in the name of
the pope. But the claim rests on slender evidence, since the first
source in which Hosius is referred to as representative of the
pope is Gelasius of Cyzicus in the Propontis, who wrote toward
the end of the 5th century. It is even open to dispute whether
Hosius was president at Nicaea, and though he certainly presided
over the council of Sardica in 343, it was probably as
representative of the emperors Constans and Constantius, who
had summoned the council. Pope Julius I. was represented at
Sardica by two presbyters. Yet the fifth canon, which provides
for appeal by a bishop to Rome, sanctions the use of embassies
<i>a latere</i>. If the appellant wishes the pope to send priests from
his own household, the pope shall be free to do so, and to furnish
them with full authority from himself (&ldquo;ut de latere suo presbyteros
mittat ... habentes ejus auctoritatem a quo destinati
sunt&rdquo;). The decrees of Sardica, an obscure council, were later
confused with those of Nicaea and thus gained weight. In the
synod of Ephesus in 431, Pope Celestine I. instructed his representatives
to conduct themselves not as disputants but as judges,
and Cyril of Alexandria presided not only in his own name but
in that of the pope (and of the bishop of Jerusalem). Instances
of delegation of the papal authority in various degrees become
numerous in the 5th century, especially during the pontificate
of Leo I. Thus Leo writes in 444 (<i>Ep.</i> 6) to Anastasius of
Thessalonica, appointing him his vicar for the province of
Illyria; the same arrangement, he informs us, had been made
by Pope Siricius in favour of Anysius, the predecessor of Anastasius.
Similar vicarial or legatine powers had been conferred
in 418 by Zosimus upon Patroclus, bishop of Arles. In 449 Leo
was represented at the &ldquo;Robber Synod,&rdquo; from which his legates
hardly escaped with life; at Chalcedon, in 451, they were
treated with singular honour, though the imperial commissioners
presided. Again, in 453 the same pope writes to the empress
Pulcheria, naming Julianus of Cos as his representative in the
defence of the interests of orthodoxy and ecclesiastical discipline
at Constantinople (<i>Ep.</i> 112); the instructions to Julianus are
given in <i>Ep.</i> 113 (&ldquo;hanc specialem curam vice mea functus
assumas&rdquo;). The designation of Anastasius as vicar apostolic
over Illyria may be said to mark the beginning of the custom of
conferring, <i>ex officio</i>, the title of <i>legatus</i> upon the holders of
important sees, who ultimately came to be known as <i>legati nati</i>,
with the rank of primate; the appointment of Julianus at
Constantinople gradually developed into the long permanent
office of <i>apocrisiarius</i> or <i>responsalis</i>. Another sort of delegation
is exemplified in Leo&rsquo;s letter to the African bishops (<i>Ep.</i> 12),
in which he sends Potentius, with instructions to inquire in his
name, and to report (&ldquo;vicem curae nostrae fratri et consacerdoti
nostro Potentio delegantes qui de episcopis, quorum culpabilis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span>
ferebatur electio, quid veritas haberet inquireret, nobisque
omnia fideliter indicaret&rdquo;). Passing on to the time of Gregory the
Great, we find him sending two representatives to Gaul in 599,
to suppress simony, and one to Spain in 603. Augustine of
Canterbury is sometimes spoken of as legate, but it does not
appear that in his case this title was used in any strictly technical
sense, although the archbishop of Canterbury afterwards attained
the permanent dignity of a <i>legatus natus</i>. Boniface, the apostle
of Germany, was in like manner constituted, according to Hincmar
(<i>Ep.</i> 30), a legate of the apostolic see by Popes Gregory II.
and Gregory III. According to Hefele (<i>Conc.</i> iv. 239), Rodoald
of Porto and Zecharias of Anagni, who were sent by Pope Nicolas
to Constantinople in 860, were the first actually called <i>legati a
latere</i>. The policy of Gregory VII. naturally led to a great
development of the legatine as distinguished from the ordinary
episcopal function. From the creation of the medieval papal
monarchy until the close of the middle ages, the papal legate
played a most important rôle in national as well as church
history. The further definition of his powers proceeded throughout
the 12th and 13th centuries. From the 16th century legates
a latere give way almost entirely to nuncios (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGENDRE, ADRIEN MARIE<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1752-1833), French mathematician,
was born at Paris (or, according to some accounts,
at Toulouse) in 1752. He was brought up at Paris, where he
completed his studies at the <i>Collège Mazarin</i>. His first published
writings consist of articles forming part of the <i>Traité de mécanique</i>
(1774) of the Abbé Marie, who was his professor; Legendre&rsquo;s
name, however, is not mentioned. Soon afterwards he was
appointed professor of mathematics in the <i>École Militaire</i> at
Paris, and he was afterwards professor in the <i>École Normale</i>.
In 1782 he received the prize from the Berlin Academy for his
&ldquo;Dissertation sur la question de balistique,&rdquo; a memoir relating
to the paths of projectiles in resisting media. He also, about
this time, wrote his &ldquo;Recherches sur la figure des planètes,&rdquo;
published in the <i>Mémoires</i> of the French Academy, of which he
was elected a member in succession to J. le Rond d&rsquo;Alembert
in 1783. He was also appointed a commissioner for connecting
geodetically Paris and Greenwich, his colleagues being P. F. A.
Méchain and C. F. Cassini de Thury; General William Roy
conducted the operations on behalf of England. The French
observations were published in 1792 (<i>Exposé des opérations
faites en France in 1787 pour la jonction des observatoires de
Paris et de Greenwich</i>). During the Revolution, he was one of
the three members of the council established to introduce the
decimal system, and he was also a member of the commission
appointed to determine the length of the metre, for which purpose
the calculations, &amp;c., connected with the arc of the meridian
from Barcelona to Dunkirk were revised. He was also associated
with G. C. F. M. Prony (1755-1839) in the formation of the great
French tables of logarithms of numbers, sines, and tangents,
and natural sines, called the <i>Tables du Cadastre</i>, in which the
quadrant was divided centesimally; these tables have never
been published (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Logarithms</a></span>). He was examiner in the
<i>École Polytechnique</i>, but held few important state offices. He
died at Paris on the 10th of January 1833, and the discourse
at his grave was pronounced by S. D. Poisson. The last of the
three supplements to his <i>Traité des fonctions elliptiques</i> was
published in 1832, and Poisson in his funeral oration remarked:
&ldquo;M. Legendre a eu cela de commun avec la plupart des
géomètres qui l&rsquo;ont précédé, que ses travaux n&rsquo;ont fini qu&rsquo;avec
sa vie. Le dernier volume de nos mémoires renferme encore
un mémoire de lui, sur une question difficile de la théorie des
nombres; et peu de temps avant la maladie qui l&rsquo;a conduit
au tombeau, il se procura les observations les plus récentes des
comètes à courtes périodes, dont il allait se servir pour appliquer
et perfectionner ses méthodes.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It will be convenient, in giving an account of his writings, to
consider them under the different subjects which are especially
associated with his name.</p>

<p><i>Elliptic Functions</i>.&mdash;This is the subject with which Legendre&rsquo;s
name will always be most closely connected, and his researches upon
it extend over a period of more than forty years. His first published
writings upon the subject consist of two papers in the <i>Mémoires de
l&rsquo;Académie Française</i> for 1786 upon elliptic arcs. In 1792 he presented
to the Academy a memoir on elliptic transcendents. The
contents of these memoirs are included in the first volume of his
<i>Exercices de calcul intégral</i> (1811). The third volume (1816) contains
the very elaborate and now well-known tables of the elliptic
integrals which were calculated by Legendre himself, with an account
of the mode of their construction. In 1827 appeared the
<i>Traité des fonctions elliptiques</i> (2 vols., the first dated 1825, the
second 1826), a great part of the first volume agrees very closely
with the contents of the <i>Exercices</i>; the tables, &amp;c., are given in the
second volume. Three supplements, relating to the researches of
N. H. Abel and C. G. J. Jacobi, were published in 1828-1832, and
form a third volume. Legendre had pursued the subject which
would now be called elliptic integrals alone from 1786 to 1827, the
results of his labours having been almost entirely neglected by his
contemporaries, but his work had scarcely appeared in 1827 when
the discoveries which were independently made by the two young
and as yet unknown mathematicians Abel and Jacobi placed the
subject on a new basis, and revolutionized it completely. The
readiness with which Legendre, who was then seventy-six years of
age, welcomed these important researches, that quite overshadowed
his own, and included them in successive supplements to his work,
does the highest honour to him (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Function</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Eulerian Integrals and Integral Calculus</i>.&mdash;The <i>Exercices de
calcul intégral</i> consist of three volumes, a great portion of the first
and the whole of the third being devoted to elliptic functions. The
remainder of the first volume relates to the Eulerian integrals and
to quadratures. The second volume (1817) relates to the Eulerian
integrals, and to various integrals and series, developments, mechanical
problems, &amp;c., connected with the integral calculus; this volume
contains also a numerical table of the values of the gamma function.
The latter portion of the second volume of the <i>Traité des fonctions
elliptiques</i> (1826) is also devoted to the Eulerian integrals, the
table being reproduced. Legendre&rsquo;s researches connected with the
&ldquo;gamma function&rdquo; are of importance, and are well known; the
subject was also treated by K. F. Gauss in his memoir <i>Disquisitiones
generales circa series infinitas</i> (1816), but in a very different manner.
The results given in the second volume of the <i>Exercices</i> are of too
miscellaneous a character to admit of being briefly described. In
1788 Legendre published a memoir on double integrals, and in 1809
one on definite integrals.</p>

<p><i>Theory of Numbers</i>.&mdash;Legendre&rsquo;s <i>Théorie des nombres</i> and Gauss&rsquo;s
<i>Disquisitiones arithmeticae</i> (1801) are still standard works upon
this subject. The first edition of the former appeared in 1798 under
the title <i>Essai sur la théorie des nombres</i>; there was a second
edition in 1808; a first supplement was published in 1816, and a
second in 1825. The third edition, under the title <i>Théorie des
nombres</i>, appeared in 1830 in two volumes. The fourth edition
appeared in 1900. To Legendre is due the theorem known as the
law of quadratic reciprocity, the most important general result in
the science of numbers which has been discovered since the time of
P. de Fermat, and which was called by Gauss the &ldquo;gem of arithmetic.&rdquo;
It was first given by Legendre in the <i>Mémoires</i> of the
Academy for 1785, but the demonstration that accompanied it was
incomplete. The symbol (a/p) which is known as Legendre&rsquo;s symbol,
and denotes the positive or negative unit which is the remainder
when a<span class="sp">1/2p(&minus;1)</span> is divided by a prime number p, does not appear in this
memoir, but was first used in the <i>Essai sur la théorie des nombres</i>.
Legendre&rsquo;s formula x: (log x&minus;1.08366) for the approximate number
of forms inferior to a given number x was first given by him also in
this work (2nd ed., p. 394) (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Number</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span></p>

<p><i>Attractions of Ellipsoids</i>.&mdash;Legendre was the author of four important
memoirs on this subject. In the first of these, entitled
&ldquo;Recherches sur l&rsquo;attraction des sphéroides homogènes,&rdquo; published
in the <i>Mémoires</i> of the Academy for 1785, but communicated to it
at an earlier period, Legendre introduces the celebrated expressions
which, though frequently called Laplace&rsquo;s coefficients, are more
correctly named after Legendre. The definition of the coefficients
is that if (1 &minus; 2h cos &phi; + h<span class="sp">2</span>)<span class="sp">&minus;1/2</span> be expanded in ascending powers of h,
and if the general term be denoted by P<span class="su">n</span>h<span class="sp">n</span>, then P<span class="su">n</span> is of the Legendrian
coefficient of the <i>n</i>th order. In this memoir also the function
which is now called the potential was, at the suggestion of Laplace,
first introduced. Legendre shows that Maclaurin&rsquo;s theorem with
respect to confocal ellipsoids is true for any position of the external
point when the ellipsoids are solids of revolution. Of this memoir
Isaac Todhunter writes: &ldquo;We may affirm that no single memoir
in the history of our subject can rival this in interest and importance.
During forty years the resources of analysis, even in the hands of
d&rsquo;Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace, had not carried the theory of
the attraction of ellipsoids beyond the point which the geometry
of Maclaurin had reached. The introduction of the coefficients
now called Laplace&rsquo;s, and their application, commence a new era
in mathematical physics.&rdquo; Legendre&rsquo;s second memoir was communicated
to the <i>Académie</i> in 1784, and relates to the conditions of
equilibrium of a mass of rotating fluid in the form of a figure of
revolution which does not deviate much from a sphere. The third
memoir relates to Laplace&rsquo;s theorem respecting confocal ellipsoids.
Of the fourth memoir Todhunter writes: &ldquo;It occupies an important
position in the history of our subject. The most striking addition
which is here made to previous researches consists in the treatment
of a planet supposed entirely fluid; the general equation for the
form of a stratum is given for the first time and discussed. For
the first time we have a correct and convenient expression for
Laplace&rsquo;s <i>n</i>th coefficient.&rdquo; (See Todhunter&rsquo;s <i>History of the Mathematical
Theories of Attraction and the Figure of the Earth</i> (1873), the
twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth chapters
of which contain a full and complete account of Legendre&rsquo;s four
memoirs. See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spherical Harmonics</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Geodesy</i>.&mdash;Besides the work upon the geodetical operations connecting
Paris and Greenwich, of which Legendre was one of the
authors, he published in the <i>Mémoires de l&rsquo;Académie</i> for 1787 two
papers on trigonometrical operations depending upon the figure of
the earth, containing many theorems relating to this subject. The
best known of these, which is called Legendre&rsquo;s theorem, is usually
given in treatises on spherical trigonometry; by means of it a small
spherical triangle may be treated as a plane triangle, certain corrections
being applied to the angles. Legendre was also the author of
a memoir upon triangles drawn upon a spheroid. Legendre&rsquo;s
theorem is a fundamental one in geodesy, and his contributions to
the subject are of the greatest importance.</p>

<p><i>Method of Least Squares</i>.&mdash;In 1806 appeared Legendre&rsquo;s <i>Nouvelles
Méthodes pour la détermination des orbites des comètes</i>, which is
memorable as containing the first published suggestion of the method
of least squares (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Probability</a></span>). In the preface Legendre remarks:
&ldquo;La méthode qui me paroît la plus simple et la plus générale
consiste à rendre minimum la somme des quarrés des erreurs, ... et
que j&rsquo;appelle méthode des moindres quarrés&rdquo;; and in an appendix
in which the application of the method is explained his words are:
&ldquo;De tous les principes qu&rsquo;on peut proposer pour cet objet, je pense
qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;en est pas de plus général, de plus exact, ni d&rsquo;une application
plus facile que celui dont nous avons fait usage dans les recherches
précédentes, et qui consiste à rendre minimum la somme des quarrés
des erreurs.&rdquo; The method was proposed by Legendre only as a
convenient process for treating observations, without reference to
the theory of probability. It had, however, been applied by Gauss
as early as 1795, and the method was fully explained, and the law
of facility for the first time given by him in 1809. Laplace also
justified the method by means of the principles of the theory of
probability; and this led Legendre to republish the part of his
<i>Nouvelles Méthodes</i> which related to it in the <i>Mémoires de l&rsquo;Académie</i>
for 1810. Thus, although the method of least squares was first
formally proposed by Legendre, the theory and algorithm and
mathematical foundation of the process are due to Gauss and
Laplace. Legendre published two supplements to his <i>Nouvelles
Méthodes</i> in 1806 and 1820.</p>

<p><i>The Elements of Geometry</i>.&mdash;Legendre&rsquo;s name is most widely
known on account of his <i>Eléments de géométrie</i>, the most successful
of the numerous attempts that have been made to supersede Euclid
as a text-book on geometry. It first appeared in 1794, and went
through very many editions, and has been translated into almost
all languages. An English translation, by Sir David Brewster,
from the eleventh French edition, was published in 1823, and is
well known in England. The earlier editions did not contain the
trigonometry. In one of the notes Legendre gives a proof of the
irrationality of &pi;. This had been first proved by J. H. Lambert
in the Berlin <i>Memoirs</i> for 1768. Legendre&rsquo;s proof is similar in principle
to Lambert&rsquo;s, but much simpler. On account of the objections
urged against the treatment of parallels in this work, Legendre
was induced to publish in 1803 his <i>Nouvelle Théorie des parallèles</i>.
His <i>Géométrie</i> gave rise in England also to a lengthened discussion
on the difficult question of the treatment of the theory of parallels.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Legendre&rsquo;s works have placed him in the
very foremost rank in the widely distinct subjects of elliptic functions,
theory of numbers, attractions, and geodesy, and have given
him a conspicuous position in connexion with the integral calculus
and other branches of mathematics. He published a memoir on
the integration of partial differential equations and a few others
which have not been noticed above, but they relate to subjects with
which his name is not especially associated. A good account of the
principal works of Legendre is given in the <i>Bibliothèque universelle
de Genève</i> for 1833, pp. 45-82.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGENDRE, LOUIS<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> (1752-1797), French revolutionist, was
born at Versailles on the 22nd of May 1752. When the Revolution
broke out, he kept a butcher&rsquo;s shop in Paris, in the rue
des Boucheries St Germain. He was an ardent supporter of
the ideas of the Revolution, a member of the Jacobin Club,
and one of the founders of the club of the Cordeliers. In spite
of the incorrectness of his diction, he was gifted with a genuine
eloquence, and well knew how to carry the populace with him.
He was a prominent actor in the taking of the Bastille (14th
of July 1789), in the massacre of the Champ de Mars (July 1791),
and in the attack on the Tuileries (10th of August 1792). Deputy
from Paris to the Convention, he voted for the death of Louis
XVI., and was sent on mission to Lyons (27th of February
1793) before the revolt of that town, and was on mission from
August to October 1793 in Seine-Inférieure. He was a member
of the <i>Comité de Sûreté Générale</i>, and contributed to the downfall
of the Girondists. When Danton was arrested, Legendre at
first defended him, but was soon cowed and withdrew his defence.
After the fall of Robespierre, Legendre took part in the reactionary
movement, undertook the closing of the Jacobin Club, was
elected president of the Convention, and helped to bring about
the impeachment of J. B. Carrier, the perpetrator of the <i>noyades</i>
of Nantes. He was subsequently elected a member of the
Council of Ancients, and died on the 13th of December 1797.</p>

English statesman, fourth son of William Legge, 1st earl of
Dartmouth (1672-1750), was born on the 29th of May 1708.
Educated at Christ Church, Oxford, he became private secretary
to Sir Robert Walpole, and in 1739 was appointed secretary of
Ireland by the lord-lieutenant, the 3rd duke of Devonshire;
being chosen member of parliament for the borough of East
Looe in 1740, and for Orford, Suffolk, at the general election
in the succeeding year. Legge only shared temporarily in the
downfall of Walpole, and became in quick succession surveyor-general
of woods and forests, a lord of the admiralty, and a lord
of the treasury. In 1748 he was sent as envoy extraordinary to
Frederick the Great, and although his conduct in Berlin was
sharply censured by George II., he became treasurer of the navy
soon after his return to England. In April 1754 he joined the
ministry of the duke of Newcastle as chancellor of the exchequer,
the king consenting to this appointment although refusing to
hold any intercourse with the minister; but Legge shared the
elder Pitt&rsquo;s dislike of the policy of paying subsidies to the landgrave
of Hesse, and was dismissed from office in November 1755.
<span class="correction" title="amended from Twleve">Twelve</span> months later he returned to his post at the exchequer
in the administration of Pitt and the 4th duke of Devonshire,
retaining office until April 1757 when he shared both the dismissal
and the ensuing popularity of Pitt. When in conjunction with
the duke of Newcastle Pitt returned to power in the following
July, Legge became chancellor of the exchequer for the third
time. He imposed new taxes upon houses and windows, and he
appears to have lost to some extent the friendship of Pitt, while
the king refused to make him a peer. In 1759 he obtained the
sinecure position of surveyor of the petty customs and subsidies
in the port of London, and having in consequence to resign his
seat in parliament he was chosen one of the members for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
Hampshire, a proceeding which greatly incensed the earl of Bute,
who desired this seat for one of his friends. Having thus incurred
Bute&rsquo;s displeasure Legge was again dismissed from the exchequer
in March 1761, but he continued to take part in parliamentary
debates until his death at Tunbridge Wells on the 23rd of August
1764. Legge appears to have been a capable financier, but the
position of chancellor of the exchequer was not at that time a
cabinet office. He took the additional name of Bilson on succeeding
to the estates of a relative, Thomas Bettersworth Bilson,
in 1754. Pitt called Legge, &ldquo;the child, and deservedly the
favourite child, of the Whigs.&rdquo; Horace Walpole said he was
&ldquo;of a creeping, underhand nature, and aspired to the lion&rsquo;s
place by the man&oelig;uvre of the mole,&rdquo; but afterwards he spoke
in high terms of his talents. Legge married Mary, daughter
and heiress of Edward, 4th and last Baron Stawel (d. 1755).
This lady, who in 1760 was created Baroness Stawel of Somerton,
bore him an only child, Henry Stawel Bilson-Legge (1757-1820),
who became Baron Stawel on his mother&rsquo;s death in 1780. When
Stawel died without sons his title became extinct. His only
daughter, Mary (d. 1864), married John Dutton, 2nd Baron
Sherborne.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGGE, JAMES<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (1815-1897), British Chinese scholar, was
born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire, in 1815, and educated at King&rsquo;s
College, Aberdeen. After studying at the Highbury Theological
College, London, he went in 1839 as a missionary to the Chinese,
but, as China was not yet open to Europeans, he remained at
Malacca three years, in charge of the Anglo-Chinese College
there. The College was subsequently moved to Hong-Kong,
where Legge lived for thirty years. Impressed with the necessity
of missionaries being able to comprehend the ideas and culture
of the Chinese, he began in 1841 a translation in many volumes
of the Chinese classics, a monumental task admirably executed
and completed a few years before his death. In 1870 he was
made an LL.D. of Aberdeen and in 1884 of Edinburgh University.
In 1875 several gentlemen connected with the China trade
suggested to the university of Oxford a Chair of Chinese Language
and Literature to be occupied by Dr Legge. The university
responded liberally, Corpus Christi College contributed the
emoluments of a fellowship, and the chair was constituted in
1876. In addition to his other work Legge wrote <i>The Life and
Teaching of Confucius</i> (1867); <i>The Life and Teaching of Mencius</i>
(1875); <i>The Religions of China</i> (1880); and other books on
Chinese literature and religion. He died at Oxford on the

<p><span class="bold">LEGHORN<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (Ital. <i>Livorno</i>, Fr. <i>Livourne</i>), a city of Tuscany,
Italy, chief town of the province of the same name, which consists
of the commune of Leghorn and the islands of Elba and
Gorgona. The town is the seat of a bishopric and of a large
naval academy&mdash;the only one in Italy&mdash;and the third largest
commercial port in the kingdom, situated on the west coast,
12 m. S.W. of Pisa by rail, 10 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901)
78,308 (town), 96,528 (commune). It is built along the seashore
upon a healthy and fertile tract of land, which forms,
as it were, an oasis in a zone of Maremma. Behind is a range
of hills, the most conspicuous of which, the Monte Nero, is
crowned by a frequented pilgrimage church and also by villas
and hotels, to which a funicular railway runs. The town itself
is almost entirely modern. The 16th-century Fortezza Vecchia,
guarding the harbour, is picturesque, and there is a good bronze
statue of the grand duke Ferdinand I. by Pietro Tacca (1577-1640),
a pupil of Giovanni da Bologna. The lofty Torre del
Marzocco, erected in 1423 by the Florentines, is fine. The
façade of the cathedral was designed by Inigo Jones. The old
Protestant cemetery contains the tombs of Tobias Smollett
(d. 1771) and Francis Horner (d. 1817). There is also a large
synagogue founded in 1581. The exchange, the chamber of
commerce and the clearing-house (one of the oldest in the
world, dating from 1764) are united under one roof in the Palazzo
del Commercio, opened in 1907. Several improvements have
been carried out in the city and port, and the place is developing
rapidly as an industrial centre. The naval academy, formerly
established partly at Naples and partly at Genoa, has been
transferred to Leghorn. Some of the navigable canals which
connected the harbour with the interior of the city have been
either modified or filled up. Several streets have been widened,
and a road along the shore has been transformed into a fine
and shady promenade. Leghorn is the principal sea-bathing
resort in this part of Italy, the season lasting from the end of
June to the end of August. A spa for the use of the Acque della
Salute has been constructed. Leghorn is on the main line from
Pisa to Rome; another line runs to Colle Salvetti. A considerable
number of important steamship lines call here. The
new rectilinear mole, sanctioned in 1881, has been built out
into the sea for a distance of 600 yds. from the old Vegliaia
lighthouse, and the docking basin has been lengthened to 490 ft.
Inside the breakwater the depth varies from 10 to 26 ft. The
total trade of the port increased from £3,853,593 in 1897 to
£5,675,285 in 1905 and £7,009,758 in 1906 (the large increase
being mainly due to a rise of over £1,000,000 in imports&mdash;mainly
of coal, building materials and machinery), the average
ratio of imports to exports being as three to two. The imports
consist principally of machinery, coal, grain, dried fish, tobacco
and hides, and the exports of hemp, hides, olive oil, soap, coral,
candied fruit, wine, straw hats, boracic acid, mercury, and
marble and alabaster. In 1885 the total number of vessels that
entered the port was 4281 of 1,434,000 tons; of these, 1251
of 750,000 tons were foreign; 688,000 tons of merchandise
were loaded and unloaded. In 1906, after considerable fluctuations
during the interval, the total number that entered was
4623 vessels of 2,372,551 tons; of these, 935 of 1,002,119 tons
were foreign; British ships representing about half this tonnage.
In 1906 the total imports and exports amounted to 1,470,000
tons including coasting trade. A great obstacle to the development
of the port is the absence of modern mechanical appliances
for loading and unloading vessels, and of quay space and dock
accommodation. The older shipyards have been considerably
extended, and shipbuilding is actively carried on, especially
by the Orlando yard which builds large ships for the Italian
navy, while new industries&mdash;namely, glass-making and copper
and brass-founding, electric power works, a cement factory,
porcelain factories, flour-mills, oil-mills, a cotton yarn spinning
factory, electric plant works, a ship-breaking yard, a motor-boat
yard, &amp;c.&mdash;have been established. Other important firms,
Tuscan wine-growers, oil-growers, timber traders, colour manufacturers,
&amp;c., have their head offices and stores at Leghorn, with
a view to export. The former British &ldquo;factory&rdquo; here was of
great importance for the trade with the Levant, but was closed
in 1825. The two villages of Ardenza and Antignano, which
form part of the commune, have acquired considerable importance,
the former in part for sea-bathing.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of Leghorn occurs in a document of
891, relating to the first church here; in 1017 it is called a castle.
In the 13th century the Pisans tried to attract a population to
the spot, but it was not till the 14th that Leghorn became a
rival of Porto Pisano at the mouth of the Arno, which it was
destined ultimately to supplant. It was at Leghorn that Urban V.
and Gregory XI. landed on their return from Avignon. When
in 1405 the king of France sold Pisa to the Florentines he kept
possession of Leghorn; but he afterwards (1407) sold it for
26,000 ducats to the Genoese, and from the Genoese the Florentines
purchased it in 1421. In 1496 the city showed its devotion
to its new masters by a successful defence against Maximilian
and his allies, but it was still a small place; in 1551 there were
only 749 inhabitants. With the rise of the Medici came a rapid
increase of prosperity; Cosmo, Francis and Ferdinand erected
fortifications and harbour works, warehouses and churches,
with equal liberality, and the last especially gave a stimulus
to trade by inviting &ldquo;men of the East and the West, Spanish
and Portuguese, Greeks, Germans, Italians, Hebrews, Turks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
Moors, Armenians, Persians and others,&rdquo; to settle and traffic
in the city, as it became in 1606. Declared free and neutral
in 1691, Leghorn was permanently invested with these privileges
by the Quadruple Alliance in 1718; but in 1796 Napoleon seized
all the hostile vessels in its port. It ceased to be a free city
by the law of 1867.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGION<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (Lat. <i>legio</i>), in early Rome, the levy of citizens
marching out <i>en masse</i> to war, like the citizen-army of any other
primitive state. As Rome came to need more than one army
at once and warfare grew more complex, <i>legio</i> came to denote
a unit of 4000-6000 heavy infantry (including, however, at first
some light infantry and at various times a handful of cavalry)
who were by political status Roman citizens and were distinct
from the &ldquo;allies,&rdquo; <i>auxilia</i>, and other troops of the second class.
The legionaries were regarded as the best and most characteristic
Roman soldiers, the most trustworthy and truly Roman;
they enjoyed better pay and conditions of service than the
&ldquo;auxiliaries.&rdquo; In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 14 (death of Augustus) there were 25
such legions: later, the number was slightly increased; finally
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 290 Diocletian reduced the size and greatly increased
the number of the legions. Throughout, the dominant features
of the legions were heavy infantry and Roman citizenship.
They lost their importance when the Barbarian invasions altered
the character of ancient warfare and made cavalry a more
important arm than infantry, in the late 3rd and 4th centuries
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> In the middle ages the word &ldquo;legion&rdquo; seems not to have
been used as a technical term. In modern times it has been
employed for organizations of an unusual or exceptional character,
such as a corps of foreign volunteers or mercenaries. See
further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Army</a></span>.</p>
<div class="author">(F. J. H.)</div>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The term legion has been used to designate regiments or corps
of all arms in modern times, perhaps the earliest example of this
being the Provincial Legions formed in France by Francis I. (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infantry</a></span>). Napoleon, in accordance with this precedent, employed
the word to designate the second-line formations which he maintained
in France and which supplied the Grande Armée with drafts.
The term &ldquo;Foreign Legion&rdquo; is often used for irregular volunteer
corps of foreign sympathizers raised by states at war, often by
smaller states fighting for independence. Unlike most foreign
legions the &ldquo;British Legion&rdquo; which, raised in Great Britain and
commanded by Sir de Lacy Evans (<i>q.v.</i>), fought in the Carlist wars,
was a regularly enlisted and paid force. The term &ldquo;foreign legion&rdquo;
is colloquially but incorrectly applied to-day to the <i>Régiments
étrangers</i> in the French service, which are composed of adventurous
spirits of all nationalities and have been employed in many arduous
colonial campaigns.</p>

<p>The most famous of the corps that have borne the name of legion
in modern times was the King&rsquo;s German Legion (see Beamish&rsquo;s
history of the corps). The electorate of Hanover being in 1805
threatened by the French, and no effective resistance being considered
possible, the British government wished to take the greater
part of the Hanoverian army into its service. But the acceptance
by the Hanoverian government of this offer was delayed until too
late, and it was only after the French had entered the country and
the army as a unit had been disbanded that the formation of the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s German Regiment,&rdquo; as it was at first called, was begun in
England. This enlisted not only ex-Hanoverian soldiers, but other
Germans as well, as individuals. Lieut.-Colonel von der Decken and
Major Colin Halkett were the officers entrusted with the formation
of the new corps, which in January 1805 had become a corps of all
arms with the title of King&rsquo;s German Legion. It then consisted of
a dragoon and a hussar regiment, five batteries, two light and four
line battalions and an engineer section, all these being afterwards
increased. Its services included the abortive German expedition
of November 1805, the expedition to Copenhagen in 1807, the
minor sieges and combats in Sicily 1808-14, the Walcheren
expedition of 1809, the expedition to Sweden under Sir John Moore
in 1808, and the campaign of 1813 in north Germany. But its
title to fame is its part in the Peninsular War, in which from first
to last it was an acknowledged <i>corps d&rsquo;élite</i>&mdash;its cavalry especially,
whose services both on reconnaissance and in battle were of the
highest value. The exploit of the two dragoon regiments of the
Legion at Garcia Hernandez after the battle of Salamanca, where
they charged and broke up two French infantry squares and captured
some 1400 prisoners, is one of the most notable incidents in the
history of the cavalry arm (see Sir E. Wood&rsquo;s <i>Achievements of
Cavalry)</i>. A general officer of the Legion, Charles Alten (<i>q.v.</i>),
commanded the British Light Division in the latter part of the war.
It should be said that the Legion was rarely engaged as a unit.
It was considered rather as a small army of the British type, most of
which served abroad by regiments and battalions while a small
portion and depot units were at home, the total numbers under
arms being about 25,000. In 1815 the period of service of the corps
had almost expired when Napoleon returned from Elba, but its
members voluntarily offered to prolong their service. It lost
heavily at Waterloo, in which Baring&rsquo;s battalion of the light infantry
distinguished itself by its gallant defence of La Haye Sainte. The
strength of the Legion at the time of its disbandment was 1100
officers and 23,500 men. A short-lived &ldquo;King&rsquo;s German Legion&rdquo;
was raised by the British government for service in the Crimean
War. Certain Hanoverian regiments of the German army to-day
represent the units of the Legion and carry Peninsular battle-honours
on their standards and colours.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGITIM,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bairn&rsquo;s Part</span>, in Scots law, the legal share of the
movable property of a father due on his death to his children.
If a father dies leaving a widow and children, the movable
property is divided into three equal parts; one-third part is
divided equally among all the children who survive, although
they may be of different marriages (the issue of predeceased
children do not share); another third goes to the widow as her
<i>jus relictae</i>, and the remaining third, called &ldquo;dead&rsquo;s part,&rdquo;
may be disposed of by the father by will as he pleases. If the
father die intestate the dead&rsquo;s part goes to the children as
next of kin. Should the father leave no widow, one-half of
the movable estate is legitim and one-half dead&rsquo;s part. In
claiming legitim, however, credit must be given for any
advance made by the father out of his movable estate during
his lifetime.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEGITIMACY,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> and <span class="bold">LEGITIMATION,</span> the status derived by
individuals in consequence of being born in legal wedlock, and
the means by which the same status is given to persons not so
born. Under the Roman or civil law a child born before the
marriage of the parents was made legitimate by their subsequent
marriage. This method of legitimation was accepted by the
canon law, by the legal systems of the continent of Europe,
of Scotland and of some of the states of the United States.
The early Germanic codes, however, did not recognize such legitimation,
nor among the Anglo-Saxons had the natural-born child
any rights of inheritance, or possibly any right other than that
of protection, even when acknowledged by its father. The
principle of the civil and canon law was at one time advocated
by the clergy of England, but was summarily rejected by the
barons at the parliament of Merton in 1236, when they replied
<i>Nolumus leges Angliae mutare</i>.</p>

<p>English law takes account solely of the fact that marriage
precedes the birth of the child; at whatever period the birth
happens after the marriage, the offspring is prima facie legitimate.
The presumption of law is always in favour of the legitimacy of
the child of a married woman, and at one time it was so strong
that Sir Edward Coke held that &ldquo;if the husband be within the
four seas, <i>i.e.</i> within the jurisdiction of the king of England,
and the wife hath issue, no proof shall be admitted to prove
the child a bastard unless the husband hath an apparent impossibility
of procreation.&rdquo; It is now settled, however, that the
presumption of legitimacy may be rebutted by evidence showing
non-access on the part of the husband, or any other circumstance
showing that the husband could not in the course of nature have
been the father of his wife&rsquo;s child. If the husband had access,
or the access be not clearly negatived, even though others at the
same time were carrying on an illicit intercourse with the wife,
a child born under such circumstances is legitimate. If the
husband had access intercourse must be presumed, unless there
is irresistible evidence to the contrary. Neither husband or wife
will be permitted to prove the non-access directly or indirectly.
Children born after a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> will, however, be
presumed to be bastards unless access be proved. A child born
so long after the death of a husband that he could not in the
ordinary course of nature have been the father is illegitimate.
The period of gestation is presumed to be <i>about</i> nine calendar
months; and if there were any circumstances from which an
unusually long or short period of gestation could be inferred,
special medical testimony would be required.</p>

<p>A marriage between persons within the prohibited degrees
of affinity was before 1835 not void, but only voidable, and
the ecclesiastical courts were restrained from bastardizing
the issue after the death of either of the parents. Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
Lyndhurst&rsquo;s act (1835) declared all such existing marriages
valid, but all subsequent marriages between persons within the
prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity were made null
and void and the issue illegitimate (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marriage</a></span>). By the
Legitimacy Declaration Act 1858, application may be made to
the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Court (in Scotland, to the
Court of Session by action of declarator) for a declaration of
legitimacy and of the validity of a marriage. The status of
legitimacy in any country depending upon the fact of the child
having been born in wedlock, it may be concluded that any
question as to the legitimacy of a child turns either on the
validity of the marriage or on whether the child has been born
in wedlock.</p>

<p><i>Legitimation</i> effected by the subsequent marriage of the parents
of the illegitimate child is technically known as legitimation
<i>per subsequens matrimonium</i>. This adoption of the Roman
law principle is followed by most of the states of the continent
of Europe (with distinctions, of course, as to <i>certain</i> illegitimate
children, or as to the forms of acknowledgment by the parent or
parents), in the Isle of Man, Guernsey, Jersey, Lower Canada,
St Lucia, Trinidad, Demerara, Berbice, Cape Colony, Ceylon,
Mauritius; it has been adopted in New Zealand (Legitimation
Act 1894), South Australia (Legitimation Act 1898, amended
1902), Queensland (Legitimation Act 1899), New South Wales
(Legitimation Act 1902), and Victoria (Registration of Births,
Deaths and Marriages Act 1903). It is to be noted, however,
that in these states the mere fact of the parents marrying does
not legitimate the child; indeed, the parents may marry, yet
the child remain illegitimate. In order to legitimate the child
it is necessary for the father to make application for its registration;
in South Australia, the application must be made by both
parents; so also in Victoria, if the mother is living, if not,
application by the father will suffice. In New Zealand, Queensland
and New South Wales, registration may be made at any time
after the marriage; in Victoria, within six months from the date
of the marriage; in South Australia, by the act of 1898, registration
was permissible only within thirty days before or after the
marriage, but by the amending act of 1902 it is allowed at any
time more than thirty days after the marriage, provided the
applicants prove before a magistrate that they are the parents
of the child. In all cases the legitimation is retrospective, taking
effect from the birth of the child. Legitimation by subsequent
marriage exists also in the following states of the American
Union: Maine, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota,
California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, N. and S. Dakota,
Idaho, Montana and New Mexico. In Massachusetts, Vermont,
Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Colorado,
Idaho, Wyoming, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Arizona,
in addition to the marriage the father must recognize or acknowledge
the illegitimate child as his. In New Hampshire, Connecticut
and Louisiana both parents must acknowledge the child,
either by an authentic act before marriage or by the contract of
marriage. In some states (California, Nevada, N. and S.
Dakota and Idaho) if the father of an illegitimate child receives
it into his house (with the consent of his wife, if married), and
treats it as if it were legitimate, it becomes legitimate for all
purposes. In other states (N. Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and
New Mexico) the putative father can legitimize the child by
process in court. Those states of the United States which have
not been mentioned follow the English common law, which also
prevails in Ireland, some of the West Indies and part of Canada.
In Scotland, on the other hand, the principle of the civil law is
followed. In Scotland, bastards could be legitimized in two ways:
either by the subsequent intermarriage of the mother of the child
with the father, or by letters of legitimation from the sovereign.
With respect to the last, however, it is to be observed that
letters of legitimation, be their clauses ever so strong, could not
enable the bastard to succeed to his natural father; for the
sovereign could not, by any prerogative, cut off the private
right of third parties. But by a special clause in the letters of
legitimation, the sovereign could renounce his right to the
bastard&rsquo;s succession, failing legitimate descendants, in favour of
him who would have been the bastard&rsquo;s heir had he been born in
lawful wedlock, such renunciation encroaching upon no right
competent to any third person.</p>

<p>The question remains, how far, if at all, English law recognizes
the legitimacy of a person born out of wedlock. Strictly speaking,
English law does not recognize any such person as legitimate
(though the supreme power of an act of parliament can,
of course, confer the rights of legitimacy), but under certain
circumstances it will recognize, for purposes of succession to
property, a legitimated person as legitimate. The general
maxim of law is that the status of legitimacy must be tried by
the law of the country where it originates, and where the law
of the father&rsquo;s domicile at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, and of
the father&rsquo;s domicile at the time of the subsequent marriage,
taken together, legitimize the child, English law will recognize
the legitimacy. For purposes of succession to real property,
however, legitimacy must be determined by the <i>lex loci rei
sitae</i>; so that, for example, a legitimized Scotsman would be
recognized as legitimate in England, but not legitimate so far
as to take lands as heir (<i>Birtwhistle</i> v. <i>Vardill</i>, 1840). The conflict
of laws on the subject yields some curious results. Thus, a
domiciled Scotsman had a son born in Scotland and then married
the mother in Scotland. The son died possessed of land in
England, and it was held that the father could not inherit from
the son. On the other hand, where an unmarried woman, domiciled
in England died intestate there, it was held that her
brother&rsquo;s daughter, born before marriage, but whilst the father
was domiciled in Holland, and legitimized by the parents&rsquo;
marriage while they were still domiciled in Holland, was entitled
to succeed to the personal property of her aunt (<i>In re Goodman&rsquo;s
Trusts</i>, 1880). <i>In re Grey&rsquo;s Trusts</i> (1892) decided that, where
<i>real estate</i> was bequeathed to the children of a person domiciled
in a foreign country and these children were legitimized
by the subsequent marriage in that country of their father
with their mother, that they were entitled to share as legitimate
children in a devise of English realty. It is to be noted
that this decision does not clash with that of <i>Birtwhistle</i> v.
<i>Vardill</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGOUVÉ, GABRIEL JEAN BAPTISTE ERNEST WILFRID<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span>
(1807-1903), French dramatist, son of the poet Gabriel Legouvé
(1764-1812), who wrote a pastoral <i>La Mort d&rsquo;Abel</i> (1793) and a
tragedy of <i>Epicharis et Néron</i>, was born in Paris on the 5th of
February 1807. His mother died in 1810, and almost immediately
afterwards his father was removed to a lunatic
asylum. The child, however, inherited a considerable fortune,
and was carefully educated. Jean Nicolas Bouilly (1763-1842)
was his tutor, and early instilled into the young Legouvé a
passion for literature, to which the example of his father and
of his grandfather, J. B. Legouvé (1729-1783), predisposed him.
As early as 1829 he carried away a prize of the French Academy
for a poem on the discovery of printing; and in 1832 he published
a curious little volume of verses, entitled <i>Les Morts Bizarres</i>.
In those early days Legouvé brought out a succession of novels,
of which <i>Edith de Falsen</i> enjoyed a considerable success. In
1847 he began the work by which he is best remembered, his
contributions to the development and education of the female
mind, by lecturing at the College of France on the moral history
of women: these discourses were collected into a volume in
1848, and enjoyed a great success. Legouvé wrote considerably
for the stage, and in 1849 he collaborated with A. E. Scribe in
<i>Adrienne Lecouvreur</i>. In 1855 he brought out his tragedy of
<i>Médée</i>, the success of which had much to do with his election
to the French Academy. He succeeded to the fauteuil of J. A.
Ancelot, and was received by Flourens, who dwelt on the plays
of Legouvé as his principal claim to consideration. As time
passed on, however, he became less prominent as a playwright,
and more so as a lecturer and propagandist on woman&rsquo;s rights
and the advanced education of children, in both of which directions
he was a pioneer in French society. His <i>La Femme en France
au XIX^<span class="sp">me</span> siècle</i> (1864), reissued, much enlarged, in 1878; his
<i>Messieurs les enfants</i> (1868), his <i>Conférences Parisiennes</i> (1872),
his <i>Nos filles et nos fils</i> (1877), and his <i>Une Éducation de jeune
fille</i> (1884) were works of wide-reaching influence in the moral
order. In 1886-1887 he published, in two volumes, his <i>Soixante
ans de souvenirs</i>, an excellent specimen of autobiography. He
was raised in 1887 to the highest grade of the Legion of Honour,
and held for many years the post of inspector-general of female
education in the national schools. Legouvé was always an
advocate of physical training. He was long accounted one
of the best shots in France, and although, from a conscientious
objection, he never fought a duel, he made the art of fencing
his life-long hobby. After the death of Désiré Nisard in 1888,
Legouvé became the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of the French Academy. He
died on the 14th of March 1903.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEGROS, ALPHONSE<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (1837-&emsp;&emsp;), painter and etcher, was
born at Dijon on the 8th of May 1837. His father was an
accountant, and came from the neighbouring village of Veronnes.
Young Legros frequently visited the farms of his relatives, and
the peasants and landscapes of that part of France are the
subjects of many of his pictures and etchings. He was sent to
the art school at Dijon with a view to qualifying for a trade,
and was apprenticed to Maître Nicolardo, house decorator and
painter of images. In 1851 Legros left for Paris to take another
situation; but passing through Lyons he worked for six months
as journeyman wall-painter under the decorator Beuchot, who
was painting the chapel of Cardinal Bonald in the cathedral.
In Paris he studied with Cambon, scene-painter and decorator
of theatres, an experience which developed a breadth of touch
such as Stanfield and Cox picked up in similar circumstances.
At this time he attended the drawing-school of Lecoq de Boisbaudran.
In 1855 Legros attended the evening classes of the
École des Beaux Arts, and perhaps gained there his love of
drawing from the antique, some of the results of which may be
seen in the Print Room of the British Museum. He sent two
portraits to the Salon of 1857: one was rejected, and formed
part of the exhibition of protest organized by Bonvin in his
studio; the other, which was accepted, was a profile portrait
of his father. This work was presented to the museum at Tours
by the artist when his friend Cazin was curator. Champfleury
saw the work in the Salon, and sought out the artist to enlist
him in the small army of so-called &ldquo;Realists,&rdquo; comprising (round
the noisy glory of Courbet) all those who raised protest against
the academical trifles of the degenerate Romantics. In 1859
Legros&rsquo;s &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; was exhibited, the first of those quiet
church interiors, with kneeling figures of patient women, by
which he is best known as a painter. &ldquo;Ex Voto,&rdquo; a work of
great power and insight, painted in 1861, now in the museum
at Dijon, was received by his friends with enthusiasm, but it
only obtained a mention at the Salon. Legros came to England
in 1863, and in 1864 married Miss Frances Rosetta Hodgson.
At first he lived by his etching and teaching. He then became
teacher of etching at the South Kensington School of Art, and
in 1876 Slade Professor at University College, London. He
was naturalized as an Englishman in 1881, and remained at
University College seventeen years. His influence there was
exerted to encourage a certain distinction, severity and truth
of character in the work of his pupils, with a simple technique
and a respect for the traditions of the old masters, until then somewhat
foreign to English art. He would draw or paint a torso
or a head before the students in an hour or even less, so that the
attention of the pupils might not be dulled. As students had
been known to take weeks and even months over a single drawing,
Legros ordered the positions of the casts in the Antique School
to be changed once every week. In the painting school he
insisted upon a good outline, preserved by a thin rub in of
umber, and then the work was to be finished in a single painting,
&ldquo;<i>premier coup</i>.&rdquo; Experiments in all varieties of art work were
practised; whenever the professor saw a fine example in the
museum, or when a process interested him in a workshop, he
never rested until he had mastered the technique and his students
were trying their &rsquo;prentice hands at it. As he had casually
picked up the art of etching by watching a comrade in Paris
working at a commercial engraving, so he began the making
of medals after a walk in the British Museum, studying the
masterpieces of Pisanello, and a visit to the Cabinet des Médailles
in Paris. Legros considered the traditional journey to Italy
a very important part of artistic training, and in order that
his students should have the benefit of such study he devoted
a part of his salary to augment the income available for a travelling
studentship. His later works, after he resigned his professorship
in 1892, were more in the free and ardent manner
of his early days&mdash;imaginative landscapes, castles in Spain,
and farms in Burgundy, etchings like the series of &ldquo;The Triumph
of Death,&rdquo; and the sculptured fountains for the gardens of the
duke of Portland at Welbeck.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEGUMINOSAE,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> the second largest family of seed-plants,
containing about 430 genera with 7000 species. It belongs to
the series Rosales of the Dicotyledons, and contains three well-marked
suborders, Papilionatae, Mimosoideae and Caesalpinioideae.
The plants are trees, shrubs or herbs of very various
habit. The British representatives, all of which belong to the
suborder Papilionatae, include a few shrubs, such as
<i>Ulex</i> (gorse, furze), <i>Cytisus</i> (broom) and <i>Genista</i>, but
the majority, and this applies to the suborder as a
whole, are herbs, such as the clovers, <i>Medicago</i>, <i>Melilotus</i>,
&amp;c., sometimes climbing by aid of tendrils which
are modified leaf-structures, as in <i>Lathyrus</i> and the
vetches (<i>Vicia</i>). Scarlet runner (<i>Phaseolus multiflorus</i>)
has a herbaceous twining stem. Woody climbers
(lianes) are represented by species of <i>Bauhinia</i> (Caesalpinioideae),
which with their curiously flattened twisted
stems are characteristic features of tropical forests,
and <i>Entada scandens</i> (Mimosoideae) also common in
the tropics; these two suborders, which are confined to
the warmer parts of the earth, consist chiefly of trees
and shrubs such as <i>Acacia</i> and <i>Mimosa</i> belonging to the
Mimosoideae, and the Judas tree of southern Europe
(<i>Cercis</i>) and tamarind belonging to the Caesalpinioideae.
The so-called acacia of European gardens (<i>Robinia
Pseudacacia</i>) and laburnum are examples of the tree
habit in the Papilionatae. Water plants are rare,
but are represented by <i>Aeschynomene</i> and <i>Neptunia</i>,
tropical genera. The roots of many species bear nodular swellings
(tubercles), the cells of which contain bacterium-like bodies
which have the power of fixing the nitrogen of the atmosphere
in such a form as to make it available for plant food. Hence
the value of these plants as a crop on poor soil or as a member
of a series of rotation of crops, since they enrich the soil by the
nitrogen liberated by the decay of their roots or of the whole
plant if ploughed in as green manure.</p>

<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and generally compound
and stipulate. A common form is illustrated by the
trefoil or clovers, which
have three leaflets springing
from a common point (digitately
trifoliate); pinnate
leaves are also frequent as
in laburnum and <i>Robinia</i>.
In Mimosoideae the leaves
are generally bipinnate
(figs. 1, 2, 3). Rarely are
the leaves simple as in
<i>Bauhinia</i>. Various departures
from the usual leaf-type
occur in association
with adaptations to different
functions or environments.
In leaf-climbers, such as pea
or vetch, the end of the rachis
and one or more pairs of
leaflets are changed into
tendrils. In gorse the leaf
is reduced to a slender spine-like
structure, though the
leaves of the seedling have
one to three leaflets. In
many Australian acacias the
leaf surface in the adult plant
is much reduced, the petiole
being at the same time flattened
and enlarged (fig. 1),
frequently the leaf is reduced
to a petiole flattened in the
vertical plane; by this
means a minimum surface
is exposed to the intense sunlight. In the garden pea the
stipules are large and foliaceous, replacing the leaflets, which
are tendrils; in <i>Robinia</i> the stipules are spiny and persist after
leaf-fall. In some acacias (<i>q.v.</i>) the thorns are hollow, and
inhabited by ants as in <i>A. sphaerocephala</i>, a central American
plant (fig. 2) and others. In some species of <i>Astragalus</i>, <i>Onobrychis</i>
and others, the leaf-stalk persists after the fall of the
leaf and becomes hard and spiny.</p>

<p class="pt2">Leaf-movements occur in many of the genera. Such are the sleep-movement
in the clovers, runner bean (<i>Phaseolus</i>), <i>Robinia</i> and
acacia, where the leaflets assume a vertical position at nightfall.
Spontaneous movements are exemplified in the telegraph-plant
(<i>Desmodium gyrans</i>), native of tropical Asia, where the small lateral
leaflets move up and down every few minutes. The sensitive plant
(<i>Mimosa pudica</i>) is an example of movement in response to contact,
the leaves assuming a sleep-position if touched. The seat of the
movement is the swollen base of the leaf-stalk, the so-called pulvinus
(fig. 3).</p>

<p>The stem of the lianes shows some remarkable deviations from
the normal in form and structure. In Papilionatae anomalous
secondary thickening arises from the production of new cambium
zones outside the original ring (<i>Mucuna</i>, <i>Wistaria</i>) forming concentric
rings or transverse or broader strands; where, as in <i>Rhyncosia</i> the
successive cambiums
are active
only at two opposite
points, a
flat ribbon-like
stem is produced.
The climbing
<i>Bauhinias</i> (Caesalpinioideae)
have a flattened
stem with basin-like
undulations;
in some growth
in thickness is
normal, in others
new cambium-zones
are found
concentrically,
while in others
new and distinct
growth-centres,
each with its
cambium-zone,
arise outside the
primary zone. The climbing Mimosoideae show no anomalous
growth in thickness, but in some cases the stem becomes strongly
winged. Gum passages in the pith and medullary rays occur, especially
in species of acacia and <i>Astragalus</i>; gum-arabic is an exudation
from the branches of <i>Acacia Senegal</i>, gum-tragacanth from
<i>Astragalus gummifer</i> and other species. Logwood is the coloured
heartwood of <i>Haematoxylon campechianum</i>; red sandalwood of
<i>Pterocarpus santalinus</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The flowers are arranged in racemose inflorescences, such as
the simple raceme (<i>Laburnum</i>, <i>Robinia</i>), which is condensed
to a head in <i>Trifolium</i>; in <i>Acacia</i> and <i>Mimosa</i> the flowers are
densely crowded (fig. 4). The flower is characterized by a
hypogynous or slightly perigynous arrangement of parts, the
anterior position of the odd sepal, the free petals, and the single
median carpel with a terminal style, simple stigma and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
alternating rows of ovules on the ventral suture of the ovary
which faces the back of the flower.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2">The arrangement of the petals and the number and cohesion of
the stamens vary in the three suborders. In Mimosoideae, the
smallest of the three, the flower is regular (fig. 4 [3]), and the sepals
and petals have a valvate aestivation, and are generally pentamerous,
but 3-6-merous flowers also occur. The sepals are more or less
united into a cup (fig. 4 [2]), and the petals sometimes cohere at
the base. The stamens vary widely in number and cohesion; in
<i>Acacia</i> (fig. 4) they are indefinite and free, in the tribe <i>Ingeae</i>, indefinite
and monadelphous, in other tribes as many or twice as many
as the petals. Frequently, as in <i>Mimosa</i>, the long yellow stamens
are the most conspicuous feature of the flower. In Caesalpinioideae
(fig. 5) the flowers are zygomorphic in a median plane and generally
pentamerous. The sepals are free, or the two upper ones united as
in tamarind, and imbricate in aestivation, rarely as in the Judas-tree
(fig. 5 [2]), valvate. The corolla shows great variety in form;
it is imbricate in aestivation, the posterior petal being innermost.
In <i>Cercis</i> (fig. 5) it clearly resembles the papilionaceous type; the
odd petal stands erect, the median pair are reflexed and wing-like,
and the lower pair enclose the essential organs. In <i>Cassia</i> all five
petals are subequal and spreading; in <i>Amherstia</i> the anterior pair
are small or absent while the three upper ones are large; in <i>Krameria</i>,
the anterior pair are represented by glandular scales, and in <i>Tamarindus</i>
are suppressed. Apetalous flowers occur in <i>Copaifera</i> and
<i>Ceratonia</i>. The stamens, generally ten in number, are free, as in
<i>Cercis</i> (fig. 5) or more or less united as in <i>Amherstia</i>, where the
posterior one is free and the rest are united. In tamarind only
three stamens are fertile. The largest suborder, Papilionatae, has a
flower zygomorphic in the median plane (figs. 6, 7). The five sepals
are generally united (figs. 7, 9), and have an ascending imbricate
arrangement (fig. 6); the calyx is often two-lipped (fig. 9 [1]). The
corolla has five unequal petals with a descending imbricate arrangement;
the upper and largest, the standard (<i>vexillum</i>), stands erect,
the lateral pair, the wings or <i>alae</i>, are long-clawed, while the anterior
pair cohere to form the keel or <i>carina</i>, in which are enclosed the
stamens and pistil. The ten stamens are monadelphous as in gorse
or broom (fig. 9), or diadelphous as in sweet pea (fig. 8) (the posterior
one being free), or almost or quite free; these differences are associated
with differences in the methods of pollination. The ten stamens
here, as in the last suborder, though arranged in a single whorl,
arise in two series, the five opposite the sepals arising first.</p>

<p>The carpel is sometimes stalked and often surrounded at the base
by a honey-secreting disk; the style is terminal and in the zygomorphic
flowers is often curved and somewhat flattened with a definite
back and front. Sometimes as in species of <i>Trifolium</i> and <i>Medicago</i>
the ovules are reduced to one. The pod or legume splits along both
sutures (fig. 10) into a pair of membranous, leathery or sometimes
fleshy valves, bearing the seeds on the ventral suture. Dehiscence
is often explosive, the valves separating elastically and twisting
spirally, thus shooting out the seeds, as in gorse, broom and others.
In <i>Desmodium</i>, <i>Entada</i> and others the pod is constricted between
each seed, and breaks up into indehiscent one-seeded parts; it is
then called a lomentum (fig. 11); in <i>Astragalus</i> it is divided by a
longitudinal septum.</p>

<p class="pt2">The pods show a very great variety in form and size. Thus in the
clovers they are a small fraction of an inch, while in the common
tropical climber <i>Entada scandens</i> they are woody structures more
than a yard long and several inches wide. They are generally more
or less flattened, but sometimes round and rod-like, as in species of
<i>Cassia</i>, or are spirally coiled as in <i>Medicago</i>. Indehiscent one-seeded
pods occur in species of clover and in <i>Medicago</i>, also in
<i>Dalbergia</i> and allied genera, where they are winged. In <i>Colutea</i>,
the bladder-senna of gardens, the pod forms an inflated bladder
which bursts under pressure; it often becomes detached and is
blown some distance before bursting. An arillar outgrowth is often
developed on the funicle, and is sometimes brightly coloured,
rendering the seed conspicuous and favouring dissemination by
birds; in such
cases the seed-coat
is hard. In
other cases the
hard seed-coat itself
is bright-coloured
as in the
scarlet seeds of
<i>Abrus precatorius</i>,
the so-called
weather-plant.
Animals also act
as the agents of
distribution in the
case of fleshy
edible pods containing
seeds with
a hard smooth
testa, which will
pass uninjured
through the body,
as in tamarind and the fruit of the carob-tree (<i>Ceratonia</i>). In
the ground-nut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>), <i>Trifolium subterraneum</i> and
others, the flower-stalks grow downwards after fertilization of the
ovules and bury the fruit in the earth. In the suborders Mimosoideae
and Papilionatae the embryo fills the seed or a small quantity of
endosperm occurs, chiefly round the radicle. In Caesalpinioideae
endosperm is absent, or present forming a thin layer round the
embryo as in the tribe <i>Bauhinieae</i>, or copious and cartilaginous as
in the <i>Cassieae</i>. The embryo has generally flat leaf-like or fleshy
cotyledons with a short radicle.</p>

<p class="pt2">Insects play an important part in the pollination of the
flowers. In the two smaller suborders the stamens and stigma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
are freely exposed and the conspicuous coloured stamens serve
as well as the petals to attract insects; in <i>Mimosa</i> and <i>Acacia</i>
the flowers are crowded in conspicuous heads or spikes. The
relation of insects to the flower has been carefully studied in
the Papilionatae, chiefly in European species. Where honey is
present it is secreted on the inside of the base of the stamens and
accumulated in the base of the
tube formed by the united filaments
round the ovary. It is
accessible only to insects with
long probosces, such as bees. In
these cases the posterior stamen
is free, allowing access to the
honey. The flowers stand more
or less horizontally; the large
erect white or coloured standard
renders them conspicuous, the
wings form a platform on which
the insect rests and the keel
encloses the stamens and pistil,
protecting them from rain and the attacks of unbidden pollen-eating
insects. In his book on the fertilization of flowers, Hermann
Müller distinguishes four types of papilionaceous flowers according
to the way in which the pollen is applied to the bee:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) Those in which the stamens and stigma return within the
carina and thus admit of repeated visits, such are the clovers,
<i>Melilotus</i> and laburnum. (2) Explosive flowers where stamens
and style are confined within the keel under tension and the pressure
of the insect causes their sudden release and the scattering of the
pollen, as in broom and <i>Genista</i>; these contain no honey but are
visited for the sake of the pollen. (3) The piston-mechanism as in
bird&rsquo;s-foot trefoil (<i>Lotus corniculatus</i>), <i>Anthyllis</i>, <i>Ononis</i> and <i>Lupinus</i>,
where the pressure of the bee upon the carina while probing for
honey squeezes a narrow ribbon of pollen through the opening at
the tip. The pollen has been shed into the cone-like tip of the
carina, and the heads of the five outer stamens form a piston beneath
it, pushing it out at the tip when pressure is exerted on the keel;
a further pressure causes the protrusion of the stigma, which is thus
brought in contact with the insect&rsquo;s belly. (4) The style bears a
brush of hairs which sweeps small quantities of pollen out of the
tip of the carina, as in <i>Lathyrus</i>, <i>Pisum</i>, <i>Vicia</i> and <i>Phaseolus</i>.</p>

<p class="pt2">Leguminosae is a cosmopolitan order, and often affords a
characteristic feature of the vegetation. Mimosoideae and
Caesalpinioideae are richly developed in the tropical rain forests,
where Papilionatae
are less conspicuous
and
mostly herbaceous;
in subtropical
forests
arborescent forms
of all three suborders
occur. In
the temperate
regions, tree-forms
are rare&mdash;thus
Mimosoideae
are unrepresented
in Europe; Caesalpinioideae
are
represented by
species of <i>Cercis</i>,
<i>Gymnocladus</i> and
<i>Gleditschia</i>; Papilionatae
by
<i>Robinia</i>; but
herbaceous Papilionatae
abound
and penetrate to
the limit of growth
of seed-plants in arctic and high alpine regions. Shrubs and undershrubs,
such as <i>Ulex</i>, <i>Genista</i>, <i>Cytisus</i> are a characteristic feature
in Europe and the Mediterranean area. Acacias are an important
component of the evergreen bush-vegetation of Australia,
together with genera of the tribe <i>Podalyrieae</i> of Papilionatae
(<i>Chorizema</i>, <i>Oxylobium</i>, &amp;c.). <i>Astragalus</i>, <i>Oxytropis</i>, <i>Hedysarum</i>,
<i>Onobrychis</i>, and others are characteristic of the steppe-formations
of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The order is a most important one economically. The seeds,
which are rich in starch and proteids, form valuable foods, as in pea,
the various beans, vetch, lentil, ground-nut (<i>Arachis</i>) and others;
seeds of <i>Arachis</i> and others yield oils; those of <i>Physostigma venenosum</i>,
the Calabar ordeal bean, contain a strong poison. Many are
useful fodder-plants, as the clovers (<i>Trifolium</i>) (<i>q.v.</i>), Medicago (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>M. sativa</i>, lucerne (<i>q.v.</i>), or alfalfa); <i>Melilotus</i>, <i>Vicia</i>, <i>Onobrychis</i>
(<i>O. sativa</i> is sainfoin, <i>q.v.</i>); species of <i>Trifolium</i>, lupine and others
are used as green manure. Many of the tropical trees afford useful
timber; <i>Crotalaria</i>, <i>Sesbania</i>, <i>Aeschynomene</i> and others yield fibre;
species of <i>Acacia</i> and <i>Astragalus</i> yield gum; <i>Copaifera</i>, <i>Hymenaea</i>
and others balsams and resins; dyes are obtained from <i>Genista</i>
(yellow), <i>Indigofera</i> (blue) and others; <i>Haematoxylon campechianum</i>
is logwood; of medicinal value are species of <i>Cassia</i> (senna leaves)
and <i>Astragalus</i>; <i>Tamarindus indica</i> is tamarind, <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i>
yields liquorice root. Well-known ornamental trees and shrubs are
<i>Cercis</i> (<i>C. siliquastrum</i> is the Judas-tree), <i>Gleditschia</i>, <i>Genista</i>, <i>Cytisus</i>
(broom), <i>Colutea</i> (<i>C. arborescens</i> is bladder-senna), <i>Robinia</i> and
<i>Acacia</i>; <i><span class="correction" title="amended from Wistaria">Wisteria</span> sinensis</i>, a native of China, is a well-known
climbing shrub; <i>Phaseolus multiflorus</i> is the scarlet runner; <i>Lathyrus</i>
(sweet and everlasting peas), <i>Lupinus</i>, <i>Galega</i> (goat&rsquo;s-rue) and
others are herbaceous garden plants. <i>Ceratonia Siliqua</i> is the carob-tree
of the Mediterranean, the pods of which (algaroba or St John&rsquo;s
bread) contain a sweet juicy pulp and are largely used for feeding
stock.</p>

<p>The order is well represented in Britain. Thus <i>Genista tinctoria</i>
is dyers&rsquo; greenweed, yielding a yellow dye; <i>G. anglica</i> is needle furze;
other shrubs are <i>Ulex</i> (<i>U. europaeus</i>, gorse, furze or whin, <i>U. nanus</i>,
a dwarf species) and <i>Cytisus scoparius</i>, broom. Herbaceous plants
are <i>Ononis spinosa</i> (rest-harrow), <i>Medicago</i> (medick), <i>Melilotus</i>
(melilot), <i>Trifolium</i> (the clovers), <i>Anthyllis Vulneraria</i> (kidney-vetch),
<i>Lotus corniculatus</i> (bird&rsquo;s-foot trefoil), <i>Astragalus</i> (milk-vetch),
<i>Vicia</i> (vetch, tare) and <i>Lathyrus</i>.</p>

researches, he may also be regarded as one of the pioneers
in geological investigation. Although he accepted the view of a

a considerable part in the demonstrations of 1848, and was
regarded as the leader of the &ldquo;Eiderdänen,&rdquo; that is, of the party
which regarded the Eider as the boundary of Denmark, and the
duchy of Schleswig as an integral part of the kingdom. He
entered the cabinet of Count A. W. Moltke in March 1848, and
was employed on diplomatic missions to London and Berlin in
connexion with the Schleswig-Holstein question. He was for

<p>The <span class="sc">Lehnin Prophecy</span> (<i>Lehninsche Weissagung, Vaticinium
Lehninense</i>), a poem in 100 Leonine verses, reputed to be from
the pen of a monk, Hermann of Lehnin, who lived about the
year 1300, made its appearance about 1690 and caused much
controversy. This so-called prophecy bewails the extinction of
the Ascanian rulers of Brandenburg and the rise of the Hohenzollern
dynasty to power; each successive ruler of the latter
house down to the eleventh generation is described, the date of
the extinction of the race fixed, and the restoration of the Roman
Catholic Church foretold. But as the narrative is only exact in
details down to the death of Frederick William, the great
elector, in 1688, and as all prophecies of the period subsequent to
that time were falsified by events, the poem came to be regarded
as a compilation and the date of its authorship placed about
the year 1684. Andreas Fromm (d. 1685), rector of St Peter&rsquo;s
church in Berlin, an ardent Lutheran, is commonly believed to
have been the forger. This cleric, resisting certain measures
taken by the great elector against the Lutheran pastors, fled the
country in 1668 to avoid prosecution, and having been received
at Prague into the Roman Catholic Church was appointed canon
of Leitmeritz in Bohemia, where he died. During the earlier
part of the 19th century the poem was eagerly scanned by the
enemies of the Hohenzollerns, some of whom believed that the
race would end with King Frederick William III., the representative
of the eleventh generation of the family.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIBNITZ<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Leibniz</span>), <span class="bold">GOTTFRIED WILHELM</span> (1646-1716),
German philosopher, mathematician and man of affairs, was
born on the 1st of July 1646 at Leipzig, where his father was
professor of moral philosophy. Though the name Leibniz,
Leibnitz or Lubeniecz was originally Slavonic, his ancestors
were German, and for three generations had been in the employment
of the Saxon government. Young Leibnitz was sent to
the Nicolai school at Leipzig, but, from 1652 when his father
died, seems to have been for the most part his own teacher.
From his father he had acquired a love of historical study. The
German books at his command were soon read through, and
with the help of two Latin books&mdash;the <i>Thesaurus Chronologicus</i>
of Calvisius and an illustrated edition of Livy&mdash;he learned Latin
at the age of eight. His father&rsquo;s library was now thrown open
to him, to his great joy, with the permission, &ldquo;Tolle, lege.&rdquo;
Before he was twelve he could read Latin easily and had begun
Greek; he had also remarkable facility in writing Latin verse.
He next turned to the study of logic, attempting already to
reform its doctrines, and zealously reading the scholastics and
some of the Protestant theologians.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen, he entered the university of Leipzig as
a law student. His first two years were devoted to philosophy
under Jakob Thomasius, a Neo-Aristotelian, who is looked upon
as having founded the scientific study of the history of philosophy
in Germany. It was at this time probably that he first made
acquaintance with the modern thinkers who had already revolutionized
science and philosophy, Francis Bacon, Cardan and
Campanella, Kepler, Galileo and Descartes; and he began to
consider the difference between the old and new ways of regarding
nature. He resolved to study mathematics. It was not, however,
till the summer of 1663, which he spent at Jena under E.
Weigel, that he obtained the instructions of a mathematician of
repute; nor was the deeper study of mathematics entered upon
till his visit to Paris and acquaintance with Huygens many years
later.</p>

<p>The next three years he devoted to legal studies, and in 1666
applied for the degree of doctor of law, with a view to obtaining
the post of assessor. Being refused on the ground of his youth
he left his native town for ever. The doctor&rsquo;s degree refused him
there was at once (November 5, 1666) conferred on him at
Altdorf&mdash;the university town of the free city of Nuremberg&mdash;where
his brilliant dissertation procured him the immediate
offer of a professor&rsquo;s chair. This, however, he declined, having,
as he said, &ldquo;very different things in view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leibnitz, not yet twenty-one years of age, was already the
author of several remarkable essays. In his bachelor&rsquo;s dissertation
<i>De principio individui</i> (1663), he defended the nominalistic
doctrine that individuality is constituted by the whole entity
or essence of a thing; his arithmetical tract <i>De complexionibus</i>,
published in an extended form under the title <i>De arte combinatoria</i>
(1666), is an essay towards his life-long project of a re-formed
symbolism and method of thought; and besides these there are
our juridical essays, including the <i>Nova methodus docendi
discendique juris</i>, written in the intervals of his journey from
Leipzig to Altdorf. This last essay is remarkable, not only for
the reconstruction it attempted of the <i>Corpus Juris</i>, but as
containing the first clear recognition of the importance of the
historical method in law. Nuremberg was a centre of the
Rosicrucians, and Leibnitz, busying himself with writings of
the alchemists, soon gained such a knowledge of their tenets
that he was supposed to be one of the secret brotherhood, and
was even elected their secretary. A more important result of
his visit to Nuremberg was his acquaintance with Johann
Christian von Boyneburg (1622-1672), formerly first minister
to the elector of Mainz, and one of the most distinguished
German statesmen of the day. By his advice Leibnitz printed
his <i>Nova methodus</i> in 1667, dedicated it to the elector, and,
going to Mainz, presented it to him in person. It was thus that
Leibnitz entered the service of the elector of Mainz, at first as
an assistant in the revision of the statute-book, afterwards on
more important work.</p>

<p>The policy of the elector, which the pen of Leibnitz was now
called upon to promote, was to maintain the security of the
German empire, threatened on the west by the aggressive power
of France, on the east by Turkey and Russia. Thus when in
1669 the crown of Poland became vacant, it fell to Leibnitz to
support the claims of the German candidate, which he did in his
first political writing, <i>Specimen demonstrationum politicarum pro
rege Polonorum eligendo</i>, attempting, under the guise of a Catholic
Polish nobleman, to show by mathematical demonstration that
it was necessary in the interest of Poland that it should have the
count palatine of Neuburg as its king. But neither the diplomatic
skill of Boyneburg, who had been sent as plenipotentiary
to the election at Warsaw, nor the arguments of Leibnitz were
successful, and a Polish prince was elected to fill the vacant
throne.</p>

<p>A greater danger threatened Germany in the aggressions of
Louis XIV. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>). Though Holland was in
most immediate danger, the seizure of Lorraine in 1670 showed
that Germany too was threatened. It was in this year that
Leibnitz wrote his <i>Thoughts on Public Safety</i>,<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in which he urged
the formation of a new &ldquo;Rheinbund&rdquo; for the protection of
Germany, and contended that the states of Europe should
employ their power, not against one another, but in the conquest
of the non-Christian world, in which Egypt, &ldquo;one of the best
situated lands in the world,&rdquo; would fall to France. The plan
thus proposed of averting the threatened attack on Germany
by a French expedition to Egypt was discussed with Boyneburg,
and obtained the approval of the elector. French relations with
Turkey were at the time so strained as to make a breach imminent,
and at the close of 1671, about the time when the war
with Holland broke out, Louis himself was approached by a
letter from Boyneburg and a short memorial from the pen of
Leibnitz, who attempted to show that Holland itself, as a
mercantile power trading with the East, might be best attacked
through Egypt, while nothing would be easier for France or
would more largely increase her power than the conquest of
Egypt. On February 12, 1672, a request came from the French
secretary of state, Simon Arnauld de Pomponne (1618-1699), that
Leibnitz should go to Paris. Louis seems still to have kept the
matter in view, but never granted Leibnitz the personal interview
he desired, while Pomponne wrote, &ldquo;I have nothing
against the plan of a holy war, but such plans, you know, since
the days of St Louis, have ceased to be the fashion.&rdquo; Not yet
discouraged, Leibnitz wrote a full account of his project for the
king,<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and a summary of the same<a name="fa3b" id="fa3b" href="#ft3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a> evidently intended for
Boyneburg. But Boyneburg died in December 1672, before
the latter could be sent to him. Nor did the former ever reach its
destination. The French quarrel with the Porte was made up,
and the plan of a French expedition to Egypt disappeared from
practical politics till the time of Napoleon. The history of this
scheme, and the reason of Leibnitz&rsquo;s journey to Paris, long
remained hidden in the archives of the Hanoverian library.
It was on his taking possession of Hanover in 1803 that Napoleon
learned, through the <i>Consilium Aegyptiacum</i>, that the idea of a
French conquest of Egypt had been first put forward by a
German philosopher. In the same year there was published in
London an account of the <i>Justa dissertatio</i><a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> of which the British
Government had procured a copy in 1799. But it was only with
the appearance of the edition of Leibnitz&rsquo;s works begun by Onno
Klopp in 1864 that the full history of the scheme was made known.</p>

<p>Leibnitz had other than political ends in view in his visit to
France. It was as the centre of literature and science that Paris
chiefly attracted him. Political duties never made him lose
sight of his philosophical and scientific interests. At Mainz
he was still busied with the question of the relation between
the old and new methods in philosophy. In a letter to Jakob
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
Thomasius (1669) he contends that the mechanical explanation
of nature by magnitude, figure and motion alone is not inconsistent
with the doctrines of Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Physics</i>, in which he
finds more truth than in the <i>Meditations</i> of Descartes. Yet these
qualities of bodies, he argues in 1668 (in an essay published
without his knowledge under the title <i>Confessio naturae contra
atheistas</i>), require an incorporeal principle, or God, for their
ultimate explanation. He also wrote at this time a defence of the
doctrine of the Trinity against Wissowatius (1669), and an essay
on philosophic style, introductory to an edition of the <i>Anti-barbarus</i>
of Nizolius (1670). Clearness and distinctness alone,
he says, are what makes a philosophic style, and no language is
better suited for this popular exposition than the German.
In 1671 he issued a <i>Hypothesis physica nova</i>, in which, agreeing
with Descartes that corporeal phenomena should be explained
from motion, he carried out the mechanical explanation of nature
by contending that the original of this motion is a fine aether,
similar to light, or rather constituting it, which, penetrating all
bodies in the direction of the earth&rsquo;s axis, produces the phenomena
of gravity, elasticity, &amp;c. The first part of the essay, on
concrete motion, was dedicated to the Royal Society of London,
the second, on abstract motion, to the French Academy.</p>

<p>At Paris Leibnitz met with Arnauld, Malebranche and, more
important still, with Christian Huygens. This was pre-eminently
the period of his mathematical and physical activity. Before
leaving Mainz he was able to announce<a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a> an imposing list of discoveries,
and plans for discoveries, arrived at by means of his
new logical art, in natural philosophy, mathematics, mechanics,
optics, hydrostatics, pneumatics and nautical science, not to
speak of new ideas in law, theology and politics. Chief among
these discoveries was that of a calculating machine for performing
more complicated operations than that of Pascal&mdash;multiplying,
dividing and extracting roots, as well as adding and subtracting.
This machine was exhibited to the Academy of Paris and to the
Royal Society of London, and Leibnitz was elected a fellow of the
latter society in April 1673.<a name="fa6b" id="fa6b" href="#ft6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a> In January of this year he had gone
to London as an attaché on a political mission from the elector
of Mainz, returning in March to Paris, and while in London
had become personally acquainted with Oldenburg, the secretary
of the Royal Society, with whom he had already corresponded,
with Boyle the chemist and Pell the mathematician. It is from
this period that we must date the impulse that directed him
anew to mathematics. By Pell he had been referred to Mercator&rsquo;s
<i>Logarithmotechnica</i> as already containing some numerical
observations which Leibnitz had thought original on his own
part; and, on his return to Paris, he devoted himself to the study
of higher geometry under Huygens, entering almost at once upon
the series of investigations which culminated in his discovery
of the differential and integral calculus (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infinitesimal
Calculus</a></span>).</p>

<p>Shortly after his return to Paris in 1673, Leibnitz ceased to
be in the Mainz service any more than in name, but in the same
year entered the employment of Duke John Frederick of Brunswick-Lüneburg,
with whom he had corresponded for some time.
In 1676 he removed at the duke&rsquo;s request to Hanover, travelling
thither by way of London and Amsterdam. At Amsterdam
he saw and conversed with Spinoza, and carried away with him
extracts from the latter&rsquo;s unpublished <i>Ethica</i>.</p>

<p>For the next forty years, and under three successive princes,
Leibnitz was in the service of the Brunswick family, and his
headquarters were at Hanover, where he had charge of the
ducal library. Leibnitz thus passed into a political atmosphere
formed by the dynastic aims of the typical German state (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hanover</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brunswick</a></span>). He supported the claim of Hanover
to appoint an ambassador at the congress of Nimeguen (1676)<a name="fa7b" id="fa7b" href="#ft7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
to defend the establishment of primogeniture in the Lüneburg
branch of the Brunswick family; and, when the proposal was
made to raise the duke of Hanover to the electorate, he had to
show that this did not interfere with the rights of the duke
of Württemberg. In 1692 the duke of Hanover was made
elector. Before, and with a view to this, Leibnitz had been
employed by him to write the history of the Brunswick-Lüneburg
family, and, to collect material for his history, had undertaken
a journey through Germany and Italy in 1687-1690, visiting and
examining the records in Marburg, Frankfort-on-the-Main,
Munich, Vienna (where he remained nine months), Venice,
Modena and Rome. At Rome he was offered the custodianship
of the Vatican library on condition of his joining the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>About this time, too, his thoughts and energies were partly
taken up with the scheme for the reunion of the Catholic and
Protestant Churches. At Mainz he had joined in an attempt
made by the elector and Boyneburg to bring about a reconciliation,
and now, chiefly through the energy and skill of the
Catholic Royas de Spinola, and from the spirit of moderation
which prevailed among the theologians he met with at Hanover
in 1683, it almost seemed as if some agreement might be arrived
at. In 1686 Leibnitz wrote his <i>Systema theologicum</i>,<a name="fa8b" id="fa8b" href="#ft8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a> in which
he strove to find common ground for Protestants and Catholics
in the details of their creeds. But the English revolution of
1688 interfered with the scheme in Hanover, and it was soon
found that the religious difficulties were greater than had at one
time appeared. In the letters to Leibnitz from Bossuet, the
landgrave of Hessen-Rheinfels, and Madame de Brinon, the
aim is obviously to make converts to Catholicism, not to arrive
at a compromise with Protestantism, and when it was found that
Leibnitz refused to be converted the correspondence ceased.
A further scheme of church union in which Leibnitz was engaged,
that between the Reformed and Lutheran Churches, met with
no better success.</p>

<p>Returning from Italy in 1690, Leibnitz was appointed librarian
at Wolfenbüttel by Duke Anton of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.
Some years afterwards began his connexion with Berlin through
his friendship with the electress Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg
and her mother the princess Sophie of Hanover. He was invited
to Berlin in 1700, and on the 11th July of that year the academy
(Akademie der Wissenschaften) he had planned was founded,
with himself as its president for life. In the same year he was
made a privy councillor of justice by the elector of Brandenburg.
Four years before he had received a like honour from the elector
of Hanover, and twelve years afterwards the same distinction
was conferred upon him by Peter the Great, to whom he gave a
plan for an academy at St Petersburg, carried out after the czar&rsquo;s
death. After the death of his royal pupil in 1705 his visits
to Berlin became less frequent and less welcome, and in 1711
he was there for the last time. In the following year he undertook
his fifth and last journey to Vienna, where he stayed till 1714.
An attempt to found an academy of science there was defeated
by the opposition of the Jesuits, but he now attained the honour
he had coveted of an imperial privy councillorship (1712), and,
either at this time or on a previous occasion (1709), was made
a baron of the empire (<i>Reichsfreiherr</i>). Leibnitz returned to
Hanover in September 1714, but found the elector George Louis
had already gone to assume the crown of England. Leibnitz
would gladly have followed him to London, but was bidden
to remain at Hanover and finish his history of Brunswick.</p>

<p>During the last thirty years Leibnitz had been busy with many
matters. Mathematics, natural science,<a name="fa9b" id="fa9b" href="#ft9b"><span class="sp">9</span></a> philosophy, theology,
history jurisprudence, politics (particularly the French wars
with Germany, and the question of the Spanish succession),
economics and philology, all gained a share of his attention;
almost all of them he enriched with original observations.</p>

<p>His genealogical researches in Italy&mdash;through which he
established the common origin of the families of Brunswick and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
Este&mdash;were not only preceded by an immense collection of
historical sources, but enabled him to publish materials for a
code of international law.<a name="fa10b" id="fa10b" href="#ft10b"><span class="sp">10</span></a> The history of Brunswick itself was
the last work of his life, and had covered the period from 768
to 1005 when death ended his labours. But the government,
in whose service and at whose order the work had been carried
out, left it in the archives of the Hanover library till it was
published by Pertz in 1843.</p>

<p>It was in the years between 1690 and 1716 that Leibnitz&rsquo;s
chief philosophical works were composed, and during the first
ten of these years the accounts of his system were, for the most
part, preliminary sketches. Indeed, he never gave a full and
systematic account of his doctrines. His views have to be
gathered from letters to friends, from occasional articles in the
<i>Acta Eruditorum</i>, the <i>Journal des Savants</i>, and other journals,
and from one or two more extensive works. It is evident,
however, that philosophy had not been entirely neglected in
the years in which his pen was almost solely occupied with other
matters. A letter to the duke of Brunswick, and another to
Arnauld, in 1671, show that he had already reached his new
notion of substance; but it is in the correspondence with Antoine
Arnauld, between 1686 and 1690, that his fundamental ideas
and the reasons for them are for the first time made clear. The
appearance of Locke&rsquo;s <i>Essay</i> in 1690 induced him (1696) to note
down his objections to it, and his own ideas on the same subjects.
In 1703-1704 these were worked out in detail and ready for
publication, when the death of the author whom they criticized
prevented their appearance (first published by Raspe, 1765).
In 1710 appeared the only complete and systematic philosophical
work of his lifetime, <i>Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu,
la liberté de l&rsquo;homme, et l&rsquo;origine du mal</i>, originally undertaken
at the request of the late queen of Prussia, who had wished a
reply to Bayle&rsquo;s opposition of faith and reason. In 1714 he
wrote, for Prince Eugene of Savoy, a sketch of his system under
the title of <i>La Monadologie</i>, and in the same year appeared his
<i>Principes de la nature et de la grâce</i>. The last few years of his
life were perhaps more occupied with correspondence than any
others, and, in a philosophical regard, were chiefly notable for
the letters, which, through the desire of the new queen of England,
he interchanged with Clarke, <i>sur Dieu, l&rsquo;âme, l&rsquo;espace, la durée</i>.</p>

<p>Leibnitz died on the 14th of November 1716, his closing years
enfeebled by disease, harassed by controversy, embittered by
neglect; but to the last he preserved the indomitable energy
and power of work to which is largely due the position he holds as,
more perhaps than any one in modern times, a man of almost
universal attainments and almost universal genius. Neither
at Berlin, in the academy which he had founded, nor in London,
whither his sovereign had gone to rule, was any notice taken of
his death. At Hanover, Eckhart, his secretary, was his only
mourner; &ldquo;he was buried,&rdquo; says an eyewitness, &ldquo;more like
a robber than what he really was, the ornament of his country.&rdquo;<a name="fa11b" id="fa11b" href="#ft11b"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
Only in the French Academy was the loss recognized, and a
worthy eulogium devoted to his memory (November 13, 1717).
The 200th anniversary of his birth was celebrated in 1846, and
in the same year were opened the Königlichsächsische Gesellschaft
der Wissenschaften and the Kaiserliche Akademie der
Wissenschaften in Leipzig and Vienna respectively. In 1883,
a statue was erected to him at Leipzig.</p>

<p>Leibnitz possessed a wonderful power of rapid and continuous
work. Even in travelling his time was employed in solving
mathematical problems. He is described as moderate in his
habits, quick of temper but easily appeased, charitable in his
judgments of others, and tolerant of differences of opinion,
though impatient of contradiction on small matters. He is
also said to have been fond of money to the point of covetousness;
he was certainly desirous of honour, and felt keenly the neglect
in which his last years were passed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Philosophy.</i>&mdash;The central point in the philosophy of Leibnitz
was only arrived at after many advances and corrections in his
opinions. This point is his new doctrine of substance (p. 702),<a name="fa12b" id="fa12b" href="#ft12b"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
and it is through it that unity is given to the succession of occasional
writings, scattered over fifty years, in which he explained his views.
More inclined to agree than to differ with what he read (p. 425),
and borrowing from almost every philosophical system, his own
standpoint is yet most closely related to that of Descartes, partly
as consequence, partly by way of opposition. Cartesianism, Leibnitz
often asserted, is the ante-room of truth, but the ante-room only.
Descartes&rsquo;s separation of things into two heterogeneous substances
only connected by the omnipotence of God, and the more logical
absorption of both by Spinoza into the one divine substance, followed
from an erroneous conception of what the true nature of substance is.
Substance, the ultimate reality, can only be conceived as force.
Hence Leibnitz&rsquo;s metaphysical view of the monads as simple, percipient,
self-active beings, the constituent elements of all things, his
physical doctrines of the reality and constancy of force at the same
time that space, matter and motion are merely phenomenal, and
his psychological conception of the continuity and development of
consciousness. In the closest connexion with the same stand his
logical principles of consistency and sufficient reason, and the
method he developed from them, his ethical end of perfection, and
his crowning theological conception of the universe as the best
possible world, and of God both as its efficient cause and its final
harmony.</p>

<p>The ultimate elements of the universe are, according to Leibnitz,
individual centres of force or monads. Why they should be individual,
and not manifestations of one world-force, he never
clearly proves.<a name="fa13b" id="fa13b" href="#ft13b"><span class="sp">13</span></a> His doctrine of individuality seems to have been
arrived at, not by strict deduction from the nature of force, but
rather from the empirical observation that it is by the manifestation
of its activity that the separate existence of the individual
becomes evident; for his system individuality is as fundamental
as activity. &ldquo;The monads,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are the very atoms of nature&mdash;in
a word, the elements of things,&rdquo; but, as centres of force, they
have neither parts, extension nor figure (p. 705). Hence their
distinction from the atoms of Democritus and the materialists.
They are metaphysical points or rather spiritual beings whose very
nature it is to act. As the bent bow springs back of itself, so the
monads naturally pass and are always passing into action without
any aid but the absence of opposition (p. 122). Nor do they, like
the atoms, act upon one another (p. 680); the action of each excludes
that of every other. The activity of each is the result of its
own past state, the determinator of its own future (pp. 706, 722).
&ldquo;The monads have no windows by which anything may go in or
out&rdquo; (p. 705).</p>

<p>Further, since all substances are of the nature of force, it follows
that&mdash;&ldquo;in imitation of the notion which we have of souls&rdquo;&mdash;they
must contain something analogous to feeling and appetite. It is the
nature of the monad to represent the many in one, and this is perception,
by which external events are mirrored internally (p. 438).
Through their own activity the monads mirror the universe (p. 725),
but each in its own way and from its own point of view, that is,
with a more or less perfect perception (p. 127); for the Cartesians
were wrong in ignoring the infinite grades of perception, and identifying
it with the reflex cognizance of it which may be called apperception.
Every monad is thus a microcosm, the universe in little,<a name="fa14b" id="fa14b" href="#ft14b"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
and according to the degree of its activity is the distinctness of its
representation of the universe (p. 709). Thus Leibnitz, borrowing
the Aristotelian term, calls the monads <i>entelechies</i>, because they
have a certain perfection (<span class="grk" title="to enteles">&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#962;</span>) and sufficiency (<span class="grk" title="autarkeia">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>)
which make them sources of their internal actions and, so to speak,
incorporeal automata (p. 706). That the monads are not pure
entelechies is shown by the differences amongst them. Excluding
all external limitation, they are yet limited by their own nature.
All created monads contain a passive element or <i>materia prima</i>
(pp. 440, 687, 725), in virtue of which their perceptions are more or
less confused. As the activity of the monad consists in perception,
this is inhibited by the passive principle, so that there arises in the
monad an appetite or tendency to overcome the inhibition and
become more perceptive, whence follows the change from one
perception to another (pp. 706, 714). By the proportion of activity
to passivity in it one monad is differentiated from another. The
greater the amount of activity or of distinct perceptions the more
perfect is the monad; the stronger the element of passivity, the
more confused its perceptions, the less perfect is it (p. 709). The
soul would be a divinity had it nothing but distinct perceptions
(p. 520).</p>

<p>The monad is never without a perception; but, when it has a
number of little perceptions with no means of distinction, a state
similar to that of being stunned ensues, the <i>monade nue</i> being perpetually
in this state (p. 707). Between this and the most distinct
perception there is room for an infinite diversity of nature among
the monads themselves. Thus no one monad is exactly the same
as another; for, were it possible that there should be two identical,
there would be no sufficient reason why God, who brings them into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
actual existence, should put one of them at one definite time and
place, the other at a different time and place. This is Leibnitz&rsquo;s
principle of the <i>identity of indiscernibles</i> (pp. 277, 755); by it his
early problem as to the principle of individuation is solved by the
distinction between genus and individual being abolished, and every
individual made <i>sui generis</i>. The principle thus established is
formulated in Leibnitz&rsquo;s law of continuity, founded, he says, on
the doctrine of the mathematical infinite, essential to geometry, and
of importance in physics (pp. 104, 105), in accordance with which
there is neither vacuum nor break in nature, but &ldquo;everything
takes place by degrees&rdquo; (p. 392), the different species of creatures
rising by insensible steps from the lowest to the most perfect form
(p. 312).</p>

<p>As in every monad each succeeding state is the consequence of the
preceding, and as it is of the nature of every monad to mirror or
represent the universe, it follows (p. 774) that the perceptive content
of each monad is in &ldquo;accord&rdquo; or correspondence with that of
every other (cf. p. 127), though this content is represented with
infinitely varying degrees of perfection. This is Leibnitz&rsquo;s famous
doctrine of pre-established harmony, in virtue of which the infinitely
numerous independent substances of which the world is composed
are related to each other and form one universe. It is essential to
notice that it proceeds from the very nature of the monads as percipient,
self-acting beings, and not from an arbitrary determination
of the Deity.</p>

<p>From this harmony of self-determining percipient units Leibnitz
has to explain the world of nature and mind. As everything that
really exists is of the nature of spiritual or metaphysical points
(p. 126), it follows that space and matter in the ordinary sense can
only have a phenomenal existence (p. 745), being dependent not on
the nature of the monads themselves but on the way in which they
are perceived. Considering that several things exist at the same
time and in a certain order of co-existence, and mistaking this constant
relation for something that exists outside of them, the mind
forms the confused perception of space (p. 768). But space and
time are merely relative, the former an order of coexistences, the
latter of successions (pp. 682, 752). Hence not only the secondary
qualities of Descartes and Locke, but their so-called primary qualities
as well, are merely phenomenal (p. 445). The monads are really
without position or distance from each other; but, as we perceive
several simple substances, there is for us an aggregate or extended
mass. Body is thus active extension (pp. 110, 111). The unity of
the aggregate depends entirely on our perceiving the monads composing
it together. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum
or empty space, any more than there are indivisible material units
or atoms from which all things are built up (pp. 126, 186, 277).
Body, corporeal mass, or, as Leibnitz calls it, to distinguish it from
the <i>materia prima</i> of which every monad partakes (p. 440), <i>materia
secunda</i>, is thus only a &ldquo;phenomenon bene fundatum&rdquo; (p. 436).
It is not a <i>substantia</i> but <i>substantiae</i> or <i>substantiatum</i> (p. 745).
While this, however, is the only view consistent with Leibnitz&rsquo;s
fundamental principles, and is often clearly stated by himself, he
also speaks at other times of the <i>materia secunda</i> as itself a composite
substance, and of a real metaphysical bond between soul and body.
But these expressions occur chiefly in the letters to des Bosses, in
which Leibnitz is trying to reconcile his views with the doctrines of
the Roman Catholic Church, especially with that of the real presence
in the Eucharist, and are usually referred to by him as doctrines of
faith or as hypothetical (see especially p. 680). The true vinculum
<i>substantiale</i> is not the <i>materia secunda</i>, which a consistent development
of Leibnitz&rsquo;s principles can only regard as phenomenal, but the
<i>materia prima</i>, through which the monads are individualized and
distinguished and their connexion rendered possible. And Leibnitz
seems to recognize that the opposite assumption is inconsistent
with his cardinal metaphysical view of the monads as the only
realities.</p>

<p>From Leibnitz&rsquo;s doctrine of force as the ultimate reality it follows
that his view of nature must be throughout dynamical. And though
his project of a <i>dynamic</i>, or theory of natural philosophy, was never
carried out, the outlines of his own theory and his criticism of the
mechanical physics of Descartes are known to us. The whole distinction
between the two lies in the difference between the mechanical
and the dynamical views of nature. Descartes started from the
reality of extension as constituting the nature of material substance,
and found in magnitude, figure and motion the explanation of the
material universe. Leibnitz, too, admitted the mechanical view of
nature as giving the laws of corporeal phenomena (p. 438), applying
also to everything that takes place in animal organisms,<a name="fa15b" id="fa15b" href="#ft15b"><span class="sp">15</span></a> even the
human body (p. 777). But, as phenomenal, these laws must find
their explanation in metaphysics, and thus in final causes (p. 155).
All things, he says (in his <i>Specimen Dynamicum</i>), can be explained
either by efficient or by final causes. But the latter method is not
appropriate to individual occurrences,<a name="fa16b" id="fa16b" href="#ft16b"><span class="sp">16</span></a> though it must be applied
when the laws of mechanism themselves need explanation (p. 678).
For Descartes&rsquo;s doctrine of the constancy of the quantity of motion
(<i>i.e.</i> momentum) in the world Leibnitz substitutes the principle
of the conservation of <i>vis viva</i>, and contends that the Cartesian
position that motion is measured by velocity should be superseded
by the law that moving force (<i>vis motrix</i>) is measured by the square
of the velocity (pp. 192, 193). The long controversy raised by this
criticism was really caused by the ambiguity of the terms employed.
The principles held by Descartes and Leibnitz were both correct,
though different, and their conflict only apparent. Descartes&rsquo;s
principle is now enunciated as the conservation of momentum, that
of Leibnitz as the conservation of energy. Leibnitz further criticizes
the Cartesian view that the mind can alter the direction of motion
though it cannot initiate it, and contends that the quantity of &ldquo;<i>vis
directiva</i>,&rdquo; estimated between the same parts, is constant (p. 108)&mdash;a
position developed in his statical theorem for determining geometrically
the resultant of any number of forces acting at a point.</p>

<p>Like the monad, body, which is its analogue, has a passive and an
active element. The former is the capacity of resistance, and
includes impenetrability and inertia; the latter is active force
(pp. 250, 687). Bodies, too, like the monads, are self-contained
activities, receiving no impulse from without&mdash;it is only by an
accommodation to ordinary language that we speak of them as doing
so&mdash;but moving themselves in harmony with each other (p. 250).</p>

<p>The psychology of Leibnitz is chiefly developed in the <i>Nouveaux
essais sur l&rsquo;entendement humain</i>, written in answer to Locke&rsquo;s
famous <i>Essay</i>, and criticizing it chapter by chapter. In these essays
he worked out a theory of the origin and development of knowledge
in harmony with his metaphysical views, and thus without Locke&rsquo;s
implied assumption of the mutual influence of soul and body.
When one monad in an aggregate perceives the others so clearly
that they are in comparison with it bare monads (<i>monades nues</i>), it
is said to be the ruling monad of the aggregate, not because it actually
does exert an influence over the rest, but because, being in close
correspondence with them, and yet having so much clearer perception,
it seems to do so (p. 683). This monad is called the entelechy
or soul of the aggregate or body, and as such mirrors the aggregate
in the first place and the universe through it (p. 710). Each soul
or entelechy is surrounded by an infinite number of monads forming
its body (p. 714); soul and body together make a living being, and,
as their laws are in perfect harmony&mdash;a harmony established between
the whole realm of final causes and that of efficient causes
(p. 714)&mdash;we have the same result as if one influenced the other.
This is further explained by Leibnitz in his well-known illustration
of the different ways in which two clocks may keep exactly the same
time. The machinery of the one may actually move that of the
other, or whenever one moves the mechanician may make a similar
alteration in the other, or they may have been so perfectly constructed
at first as to continue to correspond at every instant without
any further influence (pp. 133, 134). The first way represents the
common (Locke&rsquo;s) theory of mutual influence, the second the
method of the occasionalists, the third that of pre-established
harmony. Thus the body does not act on the soul in the production
of cognition, nor the soul on the body in the production of motion.
The body acts just as if it had no soul, the soul as if it had no body
(p. 711). Instead, therefore, of all knowledge coming to us directly
or indirectly through the bodily senses, it is all developed by the
soul&rsquo;s own activity, and sensuous perception is itself but a confused
kind of cognition. Not a certain select class of our ideas only (as
Descartes held), but all our ideas, are innate, though only worked
up into actual cognition in the development of knowledge (p. 212).
To the aphorism made use of by Locke, &ldquo;Nihil est in intellectu
quod non prius fuerit in sensu,&rdquo; must be added the clause, &ldquo;nisi
intellectus ipse&rdquo; (p. 223). The soul at birth is not comparable to
a <i>tabula rasa</i>, but rather to an unworked block of marble, the hidden
veins of which already determine the form it is to assume in the
hands of the sculptor (p. 196). Nor, again, can the soul ever be
without perception; for it has no other nature than that of a
percipient active being (p. 246). Apparently dreamless sleep is
to be accounted for by unconscious perception (p. 223); and it is by
such insensible perceptions that Leibnitz explains his doctrine of
pre-established harmony (p. 197).</p>

<p>In the human soul perception is developed into thought, and there
is thus an infinite though gradual difference between it and the mere
monad (p. 464). As all knowledge is implicit in the soul, it follows
that its perfection depends on the efficiency of the instrument by
which it is developed. Hence the importance, in Leibnitz&rsquo;s system,
of the logical principles and method, the consideration of which
occupied him at intervals throughout his whole career.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of truths&mdash;(1) truths of reasoning, and (2)
truths of fact (pp. 83, 99, 707). The former rest on the principle
of identity (or contradiction) or of possibility, in virtue of which
that is false which contains a contradiction, and that true which
is contradictory to the false. The latter rest on the principle of
sufficient reason or of reality (<i>compossibilité</i>), according to which no
fact is true unless there be a sufficient reason why it should be so and
not otherwise (agreeing thus with the <i>principium melioris</i> or final
cause). God alone, the purely active monad, has an <i>a priori</i> knowledge
of the latter class of truths; they have their source in the
human mind only in so far as it mirrors the outer world, <i>i.e.</i> in
its passivity, whereas the truths of reason have their source in our
mind in itself or in its activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span></p>

<p>Both kinds of truths fall into two classes, primitive and derivative.
The primitive truths of fact are, as Descartes held, those of
internal experience, and the derivative truths are inferred from them
in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, by their agreement
with our perception of the world as a whole. They are thus
reached by probable arguments&mdash;a department of logic which Leibnitz
was the first to bring into prominence (pp. 84, 164, 168, 169, 343).
The primitive truths of reasoning are identical (in later terminology,
analytical) propositions, the derivative truths being deduced from
them by the principle of contradiction. The part of his logic on
which Leibnitz laid the greatest stress was the separation of these
rational cognitions into their simplest elements&mdash;for he held that
the root-notions (<i>cogitationes primae</i>) would be found to be few in
number (pp. 92, 93)&mdash;and the designation of them by universal
characters or symbols,<a name="fa17b" id="fa17b" href="#ft17b"><span class="sp">17</span></a> composite notions being denoted by the
formulae formed by the union of several definite characters, and
judgments by the relation of aequipollence among these formulae,
so as to reduce the syllogism to a calculus. This is the main idea
of Leibnitz&rsquo;s &ldquo;universal characteristic,&rdquo; never fully worked out
by him, which he regarded as one of the greatest discoveries of
the age. An incidental result of its adoption would be the introduction
of a universal symbolism of thought comparable to the
symbolism of mathematics and intelligible in all languages (cf. p.
356). But the great revolution it would effect would chiefly consist
in this, that truth and falsehood would be no longer matters of
opinion but of correctness or error in calculation,<a name="fa18b" id="fa18b" href="#ft18b"><span class="sp">18</span></a> (pp. 83, 84, 89, 93).
The old Aristotelian analytic is not to be superseded; but it is to be
supplemented by this new method, for of itself it is but the ABC of
logic.</p>

<p>But the logic of Leibnitz is an art of discovery (p. 85) as well as
of proof, and, as such, applies both to the sphere of reasoning and to
that of fact. In the former it has by attention to render explicit
what is otherwise only implicit, and by the intellect to introduce
order into the <i>a priori</i> truths of reason, so that one may follow from
another and they may constitute together a <i>monde intellectuel</i>. To
this art of orderly combination Leibnitz attached the greatest importance,
and to it one of his earliest writings was devoted. Similarly,
in the sphere of experience, it is the business of the art of discovery
to find out and classify the primitive facts or data, referring every
other fact to them as its sufficient reason, so that new truths of
experience may be brought to light.</p>

<p>As the perception of the monad when clarified becomes thought,
so the appetite of which all monads partake is raised to will, their
spontaneity to freedom, in man (p. 669). The will is an effort or
tendency to that which one finds good (p. 251), and is free only in
the sense of being exempt from external control<a name="fa19b" id="fa19b" href="#ft19b"><span class="sp">19</span></a> (pp. 262, 513, 521),
for it must always have a sufficient reason for its action determined
by what seems good to it. The end determining the will is pleasure
(p. 269), and pleasure is the sense of an increase of perfection (p.
670). A will guided by reason will sacrifice transitory and pursue
constant pleasures or happiness, and in this weighing of pleasures
consists true wisdom. Leibnitz, like Spinoza, says that freedom
consists in following reason, servitude in following the passions
(p. 669), and that the passions proceed from confused perceptions
(pp. 188, 269). In love one finds joy in the happiness of another;
and from love follow justice and law. &ldquo;Our reason,&rdquo; says Leibnitz,<a name="fa20b" id="fa20b" href="#ft20b"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
&ldquo;illumined by the spirit of God, reveals the law of nature,&rdquo; and
with it positive law must not conflict. Natural law rises from the
strict command to avoid offence, through the maxim of equity
which gives to each his due, to that of probity or piety (<i>honeste
vivere</i>),&mdash;the highest ethical perfection,&mdash;which presupposes a belief
in God, providence and a future life.<a name="fa21b" id="fa21b" href="#ft21b"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Moral immortality&mdash;not
merely the simple continuity which belongs to every monad&mdash;comes
from God having provided that the changes of matter will not make
man lose his individuality (pp. 126, 466).</p>

<p>Leibnitz thus makes the existence of God a postulate of morality
as well as necessary for the realization of the monads. It is in the
<i>Théodicée</i> that his theology is worked out and his view of the universe
as the best possible world defended. In it he contends that faith
and reason are essentially harmonious (pp. 402, 479), and that
nothing can be received as an article of faith which contradicts an
eternal truth, though the ordinary physical order may be superseded
by a higher.<a name="fa22b" id="fa22b" href="#ft22b"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

<p>The ordinary arguments for the being of God are retained by
Leibnitz in a modified form (p. 375). Descartes&rsquo;s ontological proof
is supplemented by the clause that God as the <i>ens a se</i> must either
exist or be impossible (pp. 80, 177, 708); in the cosmological proof
he passes from the infinite series of finite causes to their sufficient
reason which contains all changes in the series necessarily in itself
(pp. 147, 708); and he argues teleologically from the existence of
harmony among the monads without any mutual influence to God
as the author of this harmony (p. 430).</p>

<p>In these proofs Leibnitz seems to have in view an extramundane
power to whom the monads owe their reality, though such a conception
evidently breaks the continuity and harmony of his system,
and can only be externally connected with it. But he also speaks
in one place at any rate<a name="fa23b" id="fa23b" href="#ft23b"><span class="sp">23</span></a> of God as the &ldquo;universal harmony&rdquo;; and
the historians Erdmann and Zeller are of opinion that this is the
only sense in which his system can be consistently theistic. Yet
it would seem that to assume a purely active and therefore perfect
monad as the source of all things is in accordance with the principle
of continuity and with Leibnitz&rsquo;s conception of the gradation of
existences. In this sense he sometimes speaks of God as the first or
highest of the monads (p. 678), and of created substances proceeding
from Him continually by &ldquo;fulgurations&rdquo; (p. 708) or by &ldquo;a sort of
emanation as we produce our thoughts.&rdquo;<a name="fa24b" id="fa24b" href="#ft24b"><span class="sp">24</span></a></p>

<p>The positive properties or perfections of the monads, Leibnitz
holds, exist <i>eminenter</i>, <i>i.e.</i> without the limitation that attaches to
created monads (p. 716), in God&mdash;their perception as His wisdom or
intellect, and their appetite as His absolute will or goodness (p. 654);
while the absence of all limitation is the divine independence or
power, which again consists in this, that the possibility of things
depends on His intellect, their reality on His will (p. 506). The
universe in its harmonious order is thus the realization of the divine
end, and as such must be the best possible (p. 506). The teleology
of Leibnitz becomes necessarily a <i>Théodicée</i>. God created a world
to manifest and communicate His perfection (p. 524), and, in choosing
this world out of the infinite number that exist in the region
of ideas (p. 515), was guided by the <i>principium melioris</i> (p. 506).
With this thorough-going optimism Leibnitz has to reconcile the
existence of evil in the best of all possible worlds.<a name="fa25b" id="fa25b" href="#ft25b"><span class="sp">25</span></a> With this end
in view he distinguishes (p. 655) between (1) metaphysical evil or
imperfection, which is unconditionally willed by God as essential
to created beings; (2) physical evil, such as pain, which is conditionally
willed by God as punishment or as a means to greater
good (cf. p. 510); and (3) moral evil, in which the great difficulty
lies, and which Leibnitz makes various attempts to explain. He says
that it was merely permitted not willed by God (p. 655), and, that
being obviously no explanation, adds that it was permitted because
it was foreseen that the world with evil would nevertheless be better
than any other possible world (p. 350). He also speaks of the evil
as a mere set-off to the good in the world, which it increases by contrast
(p. 149), and at other times reduces moral to metaphysical evil
by giving it a merely negative existence, or says that their evil
actions are to be referred to men alone, while it is only the power
of action that comes from God, and the power of action is good
(p. 658).</p>

<p>The great problem of Leibnitz&rsquo;s <i>Théodicée</i> thus remains unsolved.
The suggestion that evil consists in a mere imperfection, like his
idea of the monads proceeding from God by a continual emanation,
was too bold and too inconsistent with his immediate apologetic
aim to be carried out by him. Had he done so his theory would
have transcended the independence of the monads with which it
started, and found a deeper unity in the world than that resulting
from the somewhat arbitrary assertion that the monads reflect the
universe.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Leibnitz, in the more systematic and abstract
form it received at the hands of Wolf, ruled the schools of Germany
for nearly a century, and largely determined the character of the
critical philosophy by which it was superseded. On it Baumgarten
laid the foundations of a science of aesthetic. Its treatment of
theological questions heralded the German <i>Aufklärung</i>. And on
many special points&mdash;in its physical doctrine of the conservation of
force, its psychological hypothesis of unconscious perception, its
attempt at a logical symbolism&mdash;it has suggested ideas fruitful for
the progress of science.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;(1) Editions: Up to 1900 no attempt had been
made to publish the complete works. Several editions existed, but
a vast mass of MSS. (letters, &amp;c.) remained only roughly classified
in the Hanover library. The chief editions were: (1) L. Dutens
(Geneva, 1768), called <i>Opera Omnia</i>, but far from complete; (2)
G. H. Pertz, <i>Leibnizens gesammelte Werke</i> (Berlin, 1843-1863)
(1st ser. History, 4 vols.; 2nd ser. Philosophy, vol. i. correspondence
with Arnauld, &amp;c., ed. C. L. Grotefend; 3rd ser. Mathematics,
7 vols., ed. C. J. Gerhardt); (3) Foucher de Careil (planned in
20 vols., 7 published, Paris, 1859-1875), the same editor having
previously published <i>Lettres et opuscules inédits de Leibniz</i> (Paris,
1854-1857); (4) Onno Klopp, <i>Die Werke von Leibniz gemäss seinem
Handschriftlichen Nachlasse in der Königlichen Bibliothek zu Hannover</i>
(1st series, Historico-Political and Political, 10 vols., 1864-1877).
The <i>&OElig;uvres de Leibnitz</i>, by A. Jacques (2 vols., Paris, 1846) also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
deserves mention. The philosophical writings had been published
by Raspe (Amsterdam and Leipzig, 1765), by J. E. Erdmann,
<i>Leibnitii opera philos. quae extant Latina, Gallica, Germanica, omnia</i>
(Berlin, 1840), by P. Janet (2 vols., Paris, 1866, 2nd ed. 1900),
and the fullest by C. J. Gerhardt, <i>Die Philosophischen Schriften von
G. W. Leibniz</i> (7 vols., 1875-1890); cf. also <i>Die kleineren philos.
wichtigeren Schriften</i> (trans. with commentary, J. H. von Kirchmann,
1879). The German works had also been partly published separately;
G. E. Guhrauer (Berlin, 1838-1840). Of the letters various collections
had been published up to 1900, <i>e.g.</i>: C. J. Gerhardt (Halle,
1860) and <i>Der Briefwechsel von G. W. Leibnitz mit Mathematikern</i>
(1899); <i>Corrispondenza tra L. A. Muratori e G. Leibnitz</i> (1899);
and cf. <i>Neue Beiträge zum Briefwechsel zwischen D. E. Jablonsky
und G. W. Leibnitz</i> (1899).</p>

<p>In 1900 it was decided by scholars in Berlin and Paris that a
really complete edition should be published, and with this object
four German and four French critics were entrusted with the preliminary
task of correlating the MSS. in the royal library at Hanover.
This process resulted in the preparation of the <i>Kritischer Katalog
der Leibnitz-Handschriften zur Vorbereitung der interakademischen
Leibnitz-Ausgabe unternommen</i> (1908), and also in certain other
preliminary publications, <i>e.g.</i> L. Couturat, <i>Opuscules et fragments
inédits</i> (1903); E. Gerland, <i>Leibnizens nachgelassene Schriften
physikalischen, mechanischen und technischen Inhalts</i> (1906); Jean
Baruzi, <i>Leibniz</i> (1909), containing unedited MSS. and a sketch-biography;
cf. the same author&rsquo;s <i>Leibniz et l&rsquo;organisation religieuse
de la terre</i> (1907).</p>

<p><i>Translations.</i>&mdash;Of the <i>Systema Theologicum</i> (1850, C. W. Russell),

(London, 1894); the <i>Monadology and other Writings</i>, by R. Latta
(Oxford, 1898).</p>

<p><i>Biographical.</i>&mdash;The materials for the life of Leibnitz, in addition
to his own works, are the notes of Eckhart (not published till 1779),
the <i>Éloge</i> by Fontenelle (read to the French Academy in 1717), the
&ldquo;Eulogium,&rdquo; by Wolf, in the <i>Acta Eruditorium</i> for July 1717, and
the &ldquo;Supplementum&rdquo; to the same by Feller, published in his
<i>Otium Hannoveranum</i> (Leipzig, 1718). The best biography is that of
G. E. Guhrauer, <i>G. W. Freiherr von Leibnitz</i> (2 vols., Breslau, 1842;
<i>Nachträge</i>, Breslau, 1846). A shorter <i>Life of G. W. von Leibnitz, on
the Basis of the German Work of Guhrauer</i>, has been published by J. M.
Mackie (Boston, 1845). More recent works are those of L. Grote,
<i>Leibniz und seine Zeit</i> (Hanover, 1869); E. Pfleiderer, <i>Leibniz als
Patriot, Staatsmann, und Bildungsträger</i> (Leipzig, 1870); the
slighter volume of F. Kirchner, <i>G. W. Leibniz: sein Leben und

<p><span class="bold">LEICESTER, EARLS OF.<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> The first holder of this English
earldom belonged to the family of Beaumont, although a certain
Saxon named Edgar has been described as the 1st earl of Leicester.
Robert de Beaumont (d. 1118) is frequently but erroneously
considered to have received the earldom from Henry I., about
1107; he had, however, some authority in the county of Leicester
and his son Robert was undoubtedly earl of Leicester in 1131.
The 3rd Beaumont earl, another Robert, was also steward of
England, a dignity which was attached to the earldom of
Leicester from this time until 1399. The earldom reverted to
the crown when Robert de Beaumont, the 4th earl, died in
January 1204.</p>

<p>In 1207 Simon IV., count of Montfort (<i>q.v.</i>), nephew and heir
of Earl Robert, was confirmed in the possession of the earldom
by King John, but it was forfeited when his son, the famous
Simon de Montfort, was attainted and was killed at Evesham in
August 1265. Henry III.&rsquo;s son Edmund, earl of Lancaster, was
also earl of Leicester and steward of England, obtaining these
offices a few months after Earl Simon&rsquo;s death. Edmund&rsquo;s sons,
Thomas and Henry, both earls of Lancaster, and his grandson
Henry, duke of Lancaster, in turn held the earldom, which then
passed to a son-in-law of Duke Henry, William V., count of
Holland (<i>c.</i> 1327-1389), and then to another and more celebrated
son-in-law, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. When in 1399
Gaunt&rsquo;s son became king as Henry IV. the earldom was merged
in the crown.</p>

<p>In 1564 Queen Elizabeth created her favourite, Lord Robert
Dudley, earl of Leicester. The new earl was a son of John Dudley,
duke of Northumberland; he left no children, or rather none of
undoubted legitimacy, and when he died in September 1588 the
title became extinct.</p>

<p>In 1618 the earldom of Leicester was revived in favour of
Robert Sidney, Viscount Lisle, a nephew of the late earl and a
brother of Sir Philip Sidney; it remained in this family until
the death of Jocelyn (1682-1743), the 7th earl of this line, in
July 1743. Jocelyn left no legitimate children, but a certain
John Sidney claimed to be his son and consequently to be 8th
earl of Leicester.</p>

<p>In 1744, the year after Jocelyn&rsquo;s death, Thomas Coke, Baron
Lovel (<i>c.</i> 1695-1759), was made earl of Leicester, but the title
became extinct on his death in April 1759. The next family to
hold the earldom was that of Townshend, George Townshend
(1755-1811) being created earl of Leicester in 1784. In 1807
George succeeded his father as 2nd marquess Townshend, and
when his son George Ferrars Townshend, the 3rd marquess
(1778-1855), died in December 1855 the earldom again became
extinct. Before this date, however, another earldom of Leicester
was in existence. This was created in 1837 in favour of Thomas
William Coke, who had inherited the estates of his relative
Thomas Coke, earl of Leicester. To distinguish his earldom from
that held by the Townshends Coke was ennobled as earl of
Leicester of Holkham; his son Thomas William Coke (1822-1909)
became 2nd earl of Leicester in 1842, and the latter&rsquo;s
son Thomas William (b. 1848) became 3rd earl.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEICESTER, ROBERT DUDLEY,<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (<i>c.</i> 1531-1588).
This favourite of Queen Elizabeth came of an ambitious family.
They were not, indeed, such mere upstarts as their enemies
loved to represent them; for Leicester&rsquo;s grandfather&mdash;the
notorious Edmund Dudley who was one of the chief instruments
of Henry VII.&rsquo;s extortions&mdash;was descended from a younger
branch of the barons of Dudley. But the love of power was a
passion which seems to have increased in them with each succeeding
generation, and though the grandfather was beheaded by
Henry VIII. for his too devoted services in the preceding reign,
the father grew powerful enough in the days of Edward VI.
to trouble the succession to the crown. This was that John
Dudley, duke of Northumberland, who contrived the marriage
of Lady Jane Grey with his own son Guildford Dudley, and
involved both her and her husband in a common ruin with
himself. Robert Dudley, the subject of this article, was an elder
brother of Guildford, and shared at that time in the misfortunes
of the whole family. Having taken up arms with them against
Queen Mary, he was sent to the Tower, and was sentenced to
death; but the queen not only pardoned and restored him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>
liberty, but appointed him master of the ordnance. On the
accession of Elizabeth he was also made master of the horse. He
was then, perhaps, about seven-and-twenty, and was evidently
rising rapidly in the queen&rsquo;s favour. At an early age he had been
married to Amy, daughter of Sir John Robsart. The match had
been arranged by his father, who was very studious to provide in
this way for the future fortunes of his children, and the wedding
was graced by the presence of King Edward. But if it was not a
love match, there seems to have been no positive estrangement
between the couple. Amy visited her husband in the Tower
during his imprisonment; but afterwards when, under the new
queen, he was much at court, she lived a good deal apart from
him. He visited her, however, at times, in different parts of the
country, and his expenses show that he treated her liberally.
In September 1560 she was staying at Cumnor Hall in Berkshire,
the house of one Anthony Forster, when she met her death
under circumstances which certainly aroused suspicions of foul
play. It is quite clear that her death had been surmised some
time before as a thing that would remove an obstacle to Dudley&rsquo;s
marriage with the queen, with whom he stood in so high favour.
We may take it, perhaps, from Venetian sources, that she was
then in delicate health, while Spanish state papers show further
that there were scandalous rumours of a design to poison her;
which were all the more propagated by malice after the event.
The occurrence, however, was explained as owing to a fall down
stairs in which she broke her neck; and the explanation seems
perfectly adequate to account for all we know about it. Certain
it is that Dudley continued to rise in the queen&rsquo;s favour. She
made him a Knight of the Garter, and bestowed on him the castle
of Kenilworth, the lordship of Denbigh and other lands of very
great value in Warwickshire and in Wales. In September 1564
she created him baron of Denbigh, and immediately afterwards
earl of Leicester. In the preceding month, when she visited
Cambridge, she at his request addressed the university in Latin.
The honours shown him excited jealousy, especially as it was
well known that he entertained still more ambitious hopes,
which the queen apparently did not altogether discourage. The
earl of Sussex, in opposition to him, strongly favoured a match
with the archduke Charles of Austria. The court was divided,
and, while arguments were set forth on the one side against the
queen&rsquo;s marrying a subject, the other party insisted strongly
on the disadvantages of a foreign alliance. The queen, however,
was so far from being foolishly in love with him that in 1564 she
recommended him as a husband for Mary Queen of Scots. But
this, it was believed, was only a blind, and it may be doubted
how far the proposal was serious. After his creation as earl of
Leicester great attention was paid to him both at home and
abroad. The university of Oxford made him their chancellor,
and Charles IX. of France sent him the order of St Michael.
A few years later he formed an ambiguous connexion with the
baroness dowager of Sheffield, which was maintained by the lady,
if not with truth at least with great plausibility, to have been a
valid marriage, though it was concealed from the queen. Her
own subsequent conduct, however, went far to discredit her
statements; for she married again during Leicester&rsquo;s life, when
he, too, had found a new conjugal partner. Long afterwards,
in the days of James I., her son, Sir Robert Dudley, a man of
extraordinary talents, sought to establish his legitimacy; but
his suit was suddenly brought to a stop, the witnesses discredited
and the documents connected with it sealed up by an order of
the Star Chamber.</p>

<p>In 1575 Queen Elizabeth visited the earl at Kenilworth, where
she was entertained for some days with great magnificence.
The picturesque account of the event given by Sir Walter Scott
has made every one familiar with the general character of the
scene. Next year Walter, earl of Essex, died in Ireland, and
Leicester&rsquo;s subsequent marriage with his widow again gave
rise to very serious imputations against him. For report said
that he had had two children by her during her husband&rsquo;s
absence in Ireland, and, as the feud between the two earls was
notorious, Leicester&rsquo;s many enemies easily suggested that he
had poisoned his rival. This marriage, at all events, tended
to Leicester&rsquo;s discredit and was kept secret at first; but it was
revealed to the queen in 1579 by Simier, an emissary of the duke
of Alençon, to whose projected match with Elizabeth the earl
seemed to be the principal obstacle. The queen showed great
displeasure at the news, and had some thought, it is said, of
committing Leicester to the Tower, but was dissuaded from
doing so by his rival the earl of Sussex. He had not, indeed,
favoured the Alençon marriage, but otherwise he had sought
to promote a league with France against Spain. He and Burleigh
had listened to proposals from France for the conquest
and division of Flanders, and they were in the secret about
the capture of Brill. When Alençon actually arrived, indeed,
in August 1579, Dudley being in disgrace, showed himself for
a time anti-French; but he soon returned to his former policy.
He encouraged Drake&rsquo;s piratical expeditions against the Spaniards
and had a share in the booty brought home. In February 1582
he, with a number of other noblemen and gentlemen, escorted
the duke of Alençon on his return to Antwerp to be invested
with the government of the Low Countries. In 1584 he inaugurated
an association for the protection of Queen Elizabeth
against conspirators. About this time there issued from the
press the famous pamphlet, supposed to have been the work
of Parsons the Jesuit, entitled <i>Leicester&rsquo;s Commonwealth</i>, which
was intended to suggest that the English constitution was
subverted and the government handed over to one who was
at heart an atheist and a traitor, besides being a man of infamous
life and morals. The book was ordered to be suppressed
by letters from the privy council, in which it was declared
that the charges against the earl were to the queen&rsquo;s certain
knowledge untrue; nevertheless they produced a very strong
impression, and were believed in by some who had no sympathy
with Jesuits long after Leicester&rsquo;s death. In 1585 he was appointed
commander of an expedition to the Low Countries
in aid of the revolted provinces, and sailed with a fleet of fifty
ships to Flushing, where he was received with great enthusiasm.
In January following he was invested with the government
of the provinces, but immediately received a strong reprimand
from the queen for taking upon himself a function which she
had not authorized. Both he and the states general were obliged
to apologize; but the latter protested that they had no intention
of giving him absolute control of their affairs, and that it would
be extremely dangerous to them to revoke the appointment.
Leicester accordingly was allowed to retain his dignity; but
the incident was inauspicious, nor did affairs prosper greatly
under his management. The most brilliant achievement of the
war was the action at Zutphen, in which his nephew Sir Philip
Sidney was slain. But complaints were made by the states
general of the conduct of the whole campaign. He returned to
England for a time, and went back in 1587, when he made an
abortive effort to raise the siege of Sluys. Disagreements
increasing between him and the states, he was recalled by the
queen, from whom he met with a very good reception; and
he continued in such favour that in the following summer (the
year being that of the Armada, 1588) he was appointed lieutenant-general
of the army mustered at Tilbury to resist Spanish invasion.
After the crisis was past he was returning homewards
from the court to Kenilworth, when he was attacked by a sudden
illness and died at his house at Cornbury in Oxfordshire, on the
4th September.</p>

<p>Such are the main facts of Leicester&rsquo;s life. Of his character
it is more difficult to speak with confidence, but some features
of it are indisputable. Being in person tall and remarkably
handsome, he improved these advantages by a very ingratiating
manner. A man of no small ability and still more ambition,
he was nevertheless vain, and presumed at times upon his
influence with the queen to a degree that brought upon him a
sharp rebuff. Yet Elizabeth stood by him. That she was ever
really in love with him, as modern writers have supposed, is
extremely questionable; but she saw in him some valuable
qualities which marked him as the fitting recipient of high
favours. He was a man of princely tastes, especially in architecture.
At court he became latterly the leader of the Puritan party.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
and his letters were pervaded by expressions of religious feeling
which it is hard to believe were insincere. Of the darker suspicions
against him it is enough to say that much was certainly
reported beyond the truth; but there remain some facts
sufficiently disagreeable, and others, perhaps, sufficiently mysterious,
to make a just estimate of the man a rather perplexing
problem.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>No special biography of Leicester has yet been written except
in biographical dictionaries and encyclopaedias. A general account
of him will be found in the Memoirs of the Sidneys prefixed to
Collins&rsquo;s <i>Letters and Memorials of State</i>; but the fullest yet published
is Mr Sidney Lee&rsquo;s article in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
(London, 1888) where the sources are given. Leicester&rsquo;s career has
to be made out from documents and state papers, especially from
the Hatfield MSS. and Major Hume&rsquo;s <i>Calendar</i> of documents from
the Spanish archives bearing on the history of Queen Elizabeth.
This last is the most recent source. Of others the principal are
Digges&rsquo;s <i>Compleat Ambassador</i> (1655), John Nichols&rsquo;s <i>Progresses of
Queen Elizabeth</i> and the <i>Leycester Correspondence</i> edited by J. Bruce
for the Camden Society. The death of Dudley&rsquo;s first wife has
been a fruitful source of literary controversy. The most recent
addition to the evidences, which considerably alters their complexion,
will be found in the <i>English Historical Review</i>, xiii. 83,
giving the full text (in English) of De Quadra&rsquo;s letter of Sept. 11,
1560, on which so much has been built.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEICESTER, ROBERT SIDNEY,<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (1563-1626),
second son of Sir Henry Sidney (<i>q.v.</i>), was born on the 19th of
November 1563, and was educated at Christ Church, Oxford,
afterwards travelling on the Continent for some years between
1578 and 1583. In 1585 he was elected member of parliament
for Glamorganshire; and in the same year he went with his
elder brother Sir Philip Sidney (<i>q.v.</i>) to the Netherlands, where
he served in the war against Spain under his uncle Robert
Dudley, earl of Leicester. He was present at the engagement
where Sir Philip Sidney was mortally wounded, and remained
with his brother till the latter&rsquo;s death in October 1586. After
visiting Scotland on a diplomatic mission in 1588, and France
on a similar errand in 1593, he returned to the Netherlands in
1596, where he rendered distinguished service in the war for the
next two years. He had been appointed governor of Flushing
in 1588, and he spent much time there till 1603, when, on the
accession of James I., he returned to England. James raised
him at once to the peerage as Baron Sidney of Penshurst, and
he was appointed chamberlain to the queen consort. In 1605
he was created Viscount Lisle, and in 1618 earl of Leicester,
the latter title having become extinct in 1588 on the death of his
uncle, whose property he had inherited (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Leicester, Earls
of</a></span>). Leicester was a man of taste and a patron of literature,
whose cultured mode of life at his country seat, Penshurst,
was celebrated in verse by Ben Jonson. The earl died at Penshurst
on the 13th of July 1626. He was twice married; first
to Barbara, daughter of John Gamage, a Glamorganshire gentleman;
and secondly to Sarah, daughter of William Blount, and
widow of Sir Thomas Smythe. By his first wife he had a large
family. His eldest son having died unmarried in 1613, Robert,
the second son (see below), succeeded to the earldom; one of
his daughters married Sir John Hobart, ancestor of the earls
of Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Robert Sidney</span>, 2nd earl of Leicester of the 1618 creation
(1595-1677), was born on the 1st of December 1595, and was
educated at Christ Church, Oxford; he was called to the bar
in in 1618, having already served in the army in the Netherlands
during his father&rsquo;s governorship of Flushing, and having entered
parliament as member for Wilton in 1614. In 1616 he was given
command of an English regiment in the Dutch service; and
having succeeded his father as earl of Leicester in 1626, he was
employed on diplomatic business in Denmark in 1632, and in
France from 1636 to 1641. He was then appointed lord-lieutenant
of Ireland in place of the earl of Strafford, but he waited
in vain for instructions from the king, and in 1643 he was compelled
to resign the office without having set foot in Ireland.
He shared the literary and cultivated tastes of his family, without
possessing the statesmanship of his uncle Sir Philip Sidney;
his character was lacking in decision, and, as commonly befalls
men of moderate views in times of acute party strife, he failed
to win the confidence of either of the opposing parties. His
sincere protestantism offended Laud, without being sufficiently
extreme to please the puritans of the parliamentary faction;
his fidelity to the king restrained him from any act tainted
with rebellion, while his dislike for arbitrary government prevented
him giving whole-hearted support to Charles I. When,
therefore, the king summoned him to Oxford in November
1642, Leicester&rsquo;s conduct bore the appearance of vacillation,
and his loyalty of uncertainty. Accordingly, after his resignation
of the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland at the end of 1643, he retired
into private life. In 1649 the younger children of the king were
for a time committed to his care at Penshurst. He took no part
in public affairs during the Commonwealth; and although at
the Restoration he took his seat in the House of Lords and was
sworn of the privy council, he continued to live for the most
part in retirement at Penshurst, where he died on the 2nd of
November 1677. Leicester married, in 1616, Dorothy, daughter
of Henry Percy, 9th earl of Northumberland, by whom he had
fifteen children. Of his nine daughters, the eldest, Dorothy,
the &ldquo;Sacharissa&rdquo; of the poet Waller, married Robert Spencer,
2nd earl of Sunderland; and Lucy married John Pelham, by
whom she was the ancestress of the 18th-century statesmen,
Henry Pelham, and Thomas Pelham, duke of Newcastle. Algernon
Sidney (<i>q.v.</i>), and Henry Sidney, earl of Romney (<i>q.v.</i>),
were younger sons of the earl.</p>

<p>Leicester&rsquo;s eldest son, Philip, 3rd earl (1619-1698), known
for most of his life as Lord Lisle, took a somewhat prominent
part during the civil war. Being sent to Ireland in 1642 in
command of a regiment of horse, he became lieutenant-general
under Ormonde; he strongly favoured the parliamentary cause,
and in 1647 he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland by the
parliament. Named one of Charles I.&rsquo;s judges, he refused to
take part in the trial; but he afterwards served in Cromwell&rsquo;s
Council of State, and sat in the Protector&rsquo;s House of Lords.
Lisle stood high in Cromwell&rsquo;s favour, but nevertheless obtained
a pardon at the Restoration. He carried on the Sidney family
tradition by his patronage of men of letters; and, having succeeded
to the earldom on his father&rsquo;s death in 1677, he died in
1698, and was succeeded in the peerage by his son Robert, 4th
earl of Leicester (1649-1702), whose mother was Catherine,
daughter of William Cecil, 2nd earl of Salisbury.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEICESTER, THOMAS WILLIAM COKE,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (1754-1842),
English agriculturist, known as Coke of Norfolk, was
the eldest son of Wenman Roberts, who assumed the name of
Coke in 1750. In 1759 Wenman Coke&rsquo;s maternal uncle Thomas
Coke, earl of Leicester, died leaving him his estates, subject,
however, to the life-interest of his widow, Margaret, Baroness
de Clifford in her own right. This lady&rsquo;s death in 1775 was
followed by that of Wenman Coke in 1776, when the latter&rsquo;s
son, Thomas William, born on the 6th of May 1754, succeeded
to his father&rsquo;s estates at Holkham and elsewhere. From 1776
to 1784, from 1790 to 1806, and again from 1807 to 1832 Coke
was member of parliament for Norfolk; he was a friend and
supporter of Charles James Fox and a sturdy and aggressive
Whig, acting upon the maxim taught him by his father &ldquo;never
to trust a Tory.&rdquo; Coke&rsquo;s chief interests, however, were in the
country, and his fame is that of an agriculturist. His land
around Holkham in Norfolk was poor and neglected, but he
introduced many improvements, obtained the best expert
advice, and in a few years wheat was grown upon his farms,
and the breed of cattle, sheep and pigs greatly improved. It
has been said that &ldquo;his practice is really the basis of every
treatise on modern agriculture.&rdquo; Under his direction the rental
of the Holkham estate is said to have increased from £2200 to
over £20,000 a year. In 1837 Coke was created earl of Leicester
of Holkham. Leicester, who was a strong and handsome man
and a fine sportsman, died at Longford Hall in Derbyshire on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
the 30th of June 1842. He was twice married, and Thomas
William, his son by his second marriage, succeeded to his
earldom.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEICESTER,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> a municipal county and parliamentary borough,
and the county town of Leicestershire, England; on the river
Soar, a southern tributary of the Trent. Pop. (1891) 174,624,
(1901) 211,579. It is 99 m. N.N.W. from London by the
Midland railway, and is served by the Great Central and branches
of the Great Northern and London and North-Western railways,
and by the Leicester canal.</p>

<p>This was the Roman <i>Ratae</i> (<i>Ratae Coritanorum</i>), and Roman
remains of high interest are preserved. They include a portion
of Roman masonry known as the Jewry Wall; several pavements
have been unearthed; and in the museum, among other remains,
is a milestone from the Fosse Way, marking a distance of 2 m.
from Ratae. St Nicholas church is a good example of early
Norman work, in the building of which Roman bricks are used.
St Mary de Castro church, with Norman remains, including
sedilia, shows rich Early English work in the tower and elsewhere,
and has a Decorated spire and later additions. All Saints
church has Norman remains. St Martin&rsquo;s is mainly Early English,
a fine cruciform structure. St Margaret&rsquo;s, with Early English
nave, has extensive additions of beautiful Perpendicular workmanship.
North of the town are slight remains of an abbey of
Black Canons founded in 1143. There are a number of modern
churches. Of the Castle there are parts of the Norman hall,
modernized, two gateways and other remains, together with
the artificial Mount on which the keep stood. The following
public buildings and institutions may be mentioned&mdash;municipal
buildings (1876), old town hall, formerly the gild-hall of Corpus
Christi; market house, free library, opera house and other
theatres and museum. The free library has several branches;
there are also a valuable old library founded in the 17th
century, a permanent library and a literary and philosophical
society. Among several hospitals are Trinity hospital, founded
in 1331 by Henry Plantagenet, earl of Lancaster and of Leicester,
and Wyggeston&rsquo;s hospital (1513). The Wyggeston schools
and Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s grammar school are amalgamated, and
include high schools for boys and girls; there are also Newton&rsquo;s
greencoat school for boys, and municipal technical and art
schools. A memorial clock tower was erected in 1868 to Simon
de Montfort and other historical figures connected with the town.
The Abbey Park is a beautiful pleasure ground; there are also
Victoria Park, St Margaret&rsquo;s Pasture and other grounds. The
staple trade is hosiery, an old-established industry; there are
also manufactures of elastic webbing, cotton and lace, iron-works,
makings and brick-works. Leicester became a county borough
in 1888, and the bounds were extended and constituted one
civil parish in 1892. It is a suffragan bishopric in the diocese
of Peterborough. The parliamentary borough returns two
members. Area, 8586 acres.</p>

<p>The Romano-British town of <i>Ratae Coritanorum</i>, on the Fosse
Way, was a municipality in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 120-121. Its importance,
both commercial and military, was considerable, as is attested
by the many remains found here. Leicester (<i>Ledecestre</i>, <i>Legecestria</i>,
<i>Leyrcestria</i>) was called a &ldquo;burh&rdquo; in 918, and a city in
Domesday. Until 874 it was the seat of a bishopric. In 1086
both the king and Hugh de Grantmesnil had much land in
Leicester; by 1101 the latter&rsquo;s share had passed to Robert
of Meulan, to whom the rest of the town belonged before his
death. Leicester thus became the largest mesne borough.
Between 1103 and 1118 Robert granted his first charter to the
burgesses, confirming their merchant gild. The portmanmote
was confirmed by his son. In the 13th century the town
developed its own form of government by a mayor and 24 jurats.
In 1464 Edward IV. made the mayor and 4 of the council justices
of the peace. In 1489 Henry VII. added 48 burgesses to the
council for certain purposes, and made it a close body; he granted
another charter in 1505. In 1589 Elizabeth incorporated the
town, and gave another charter in 1599. James I. granted charters
in 1605 and 1610; and Charles I. in 1630. In 1684 the charters
were surrendered; a new one granted by James II. was rescinded
by proclamation in 1688.</p>

<p>Leicester has been represented in parliament by two members
since 1295. It has had a prescriptive market since the 13th
century, now held on Wednesday and Saturday. Before 1228-1229
the burgesses had a fair from July 31 to August 14; changes
were made in its date, which was fixed in 1360 at September 26
to October 2. It is now held on the second Thursday in October
and three following days. In 1473 another fair was granted on
April 27 to May 4. It is now held on the second Thursday in
May and the three following days. Henry VIII. granted two
three-day fairs beginning on December 8 and June 26; the first
is now held on the second Friday in December; the second was
held in 1888 on the last Tuesday in June. In 1307 Edward III.
granted a fair for seventeen days after the feast of the Holy
Trinity. This would fall in May or June, and may have merged
in other fairs. In 1794 the corporation sanctioned fairs on
January 4, June 1, August 1, September 13 and November 2.
Other fairs are now held on the second Fridays in March and
July and the Saturdays next before Easter and in Easter week.
Leicester has been a centre for brewing and the manufacture
of woollen goods since the 13th century. Knitting frames for
hosiery were introduced about 1680. Boot manufacture became
important in the 19th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEICESTERSHIRE,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> a midland county of England, bounded N.
by Nottinghamshire, E. by Lincolnshire and Rutland, S.E. by
Northamptonshire, S.W. by Warwickshire, and N.W. by Derbyshire,
also touching Staffordshire on the W. The area is 823.6
sq. m. The surface of the county is an undulating tableland,
the highest eminences being the rugged hills of Charnwood
Forest (<i>q.v.</i>) in the north-west, one of which, Bardon Hill, has
an elevation of 912 ft. The county belongs chiefly to the basin of
the Trent, which forms for a short distance its boundary with
Derbyshire. The principal tributary of the Trent in Leicestershire
is the Soar, from whose old designation the <i>Leire</i> the county
is said to derive its name, and which rises near Hinckley in the
S.E., and forms the boundary with Nottinghamshire for some
distance above its junction with the Trent. The Wreak, which,
under the name of the Eye, rises on the borders of Rutland, flows
S.W. to the Soar. Besides the Soar the other tributaries of the
Trent are the Anker, touching the boundary with Warwickshire,
the Devon and the Mease. A portion of the county in the S.
drains to the Avon, which forms part of the boundary with
Northamptonshire, and receives the Swift. The Welland forms
for some distance the boundary with Northamptonshire.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The oldest rocks in the county belong to the Charnian
System, a Pre-Cambrian series of volcanic ashes, grits and slates,
into which porphyroid and syenite were afterwards intruded.
These rocks emerge from the plain formed by the Keuper Marls of
the Triassic System as a group of isolated hills and peaks (known as
Charnwood Forest); these are the tops of an old mountain-range,
the lower slopes of which are still buried under the surrounding
Keuper Marls. West of this district lies the Leicestershire coalfield,
where the poor state of development of the Carboniferous Limestone
shows that the Charnian rocks formed shoals or islands in the Carboniferous
Limestone sea. The Millstone Grit just enters the
county to the north of the same region, while the Coal Measures
occupy a considerable area round Ashby-de-la-Zouch and contain
valuable coal-seams. The rest of the county is almost equally
divided between the red Keuper Marls of the Trias on the west and
the grey limestones and shales of the Lias on the east. The former
were deposited in lagoons into which the land was gradually lowered
after a prolonged period of desert conditions. The Rhaetic beds
which follow the Keuper mark the incoming of the sea and introduce
the fossiliferous Liassic deposits. On the eastern margin of the
county a few small outliers of the Inferior Oolite sands and limestones
are present. The Glacial Period has left boulder-clay, gravel and
erratic blocks scattered over the surface, while later gravels, with
remains of mammoth, reindeer, &amp;c., border some of the present
streams.</p>

<p>Slates, honestones, setts and roadstone from the Charnian rocks,
limestone and cement from the Carboniferous and Lias, and coal
from the Coal Measures are the chief mineral products.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The climate is mild, and, on account of the inland
position of the county, and the absence of any very high elevations,
the rainfall is very moderate. The soil is of a loamy character, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
richest district being that east of the Soar, which is occupied by
pasture, while the corn crops are grown chiefly on a lighter soil
resting above the Red Sandstone formation. About nine-tenths of
the total area is under cultivation. The proportion of pasture
land is large and increasing. It is especially rich along the river-banks.
Dairy-farming is extensively carried on, the famous Stilton
cheese being produced near Melton Mowbray. Cattle are reared in
large numbers, while of sheep the New Leicester breed is well known.
It was introduced by Robert Bakewell the agriculturist, who was
born near Loughborough in 1725. He also improved the breed of
horses by the importation of mares from Flanders.</p>

<p>The county is especially famed for fox-hunting, Leicester and
Melton Mowbray being favourite centres, while the kennels of the
Quorn hunt are located at Quorndon near Mount Sorrel. For this
reason Leicestershire is rich in good riding horses.</p>

<p><i>Other Industries.</i>&mdash;Coal is worked in the districts about Moira,
Coleorton and Coalville. Limestone is worked in various parts,
freestone is plentiful, gypsum is found, and a kind of granite, extensively
used for paving, is obtained in the Charnwood district,
as at Bardon and Mount Sorrel, and at Sapcote and Stoney Stanton
in the south-west. Apart from the mining industries, the staple
manufacture of Leicestershire is hosiery, for which the wool is
obtained principally from home-bred sheep. Its principal seats are
Leicester, Loughborough, Hinckley and Castle Donington. Cotton
hose are likewise made, and other industries include the manufacture
of boots and shoes, as at Market Harborough, elastic webbing, and
bricks, also iron founding. Melton Mowbray gives name to a well-known
manufacture of pork pies.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The main line of the Midland railway serves
Market Harborough, Leicester, and Loughborough, having an
important junction at Trent (on that river) for Derby and Nottingham.
Branches radiate from Leicester to Melton Mowbray, to
Coalville, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Moira and Burton-upon-Trent, with
others through the mining district of the N.W., which is also served
by the branch of the London &amp; North-Western railway from
Nuneaton to Market Bosworth, Coalville and Loughborough. This
company serves Market Harborough from Rugby, and branches of
the Great Northern serve Market Harborough, Leicester and Melton
Mowbray. The main line of the Great Central railway passes
through Lutterworth, Leicester and Loughborough. The principal
canals are the Union and Grand Union, with which various branches
are connected with the Grand Junction, and the Ashby-de-la-Zouch
canal, which joins the Coventry canal at Nuneaton. The Loughborough
canal serves that town, connecting with the river Soar.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The area of the ancient county
is 527,123 acres; pop. (1891) 373,584, (1901) 434,019. The area
of the administrative county is 532,788 acres. The county contains
six hundreds. The municipal boroughs are: Leicester, the
county town and a county borough (pop. 211,579), Loughborough
(21,508). The urban districts are: Ashby-de-la-Zouch (4726), Ashby
Woulds (2799), Coalville (15,281), Hinckley (11,304), Market Harborough
(7735), Melton Mowbray (7454), Quorndon (2173), Shepshed
(5293). Thurmaston (1732), Wigston Magna (8404). The county is
in the Midland circuit, has one court of quarter sessions, and is
divided into 9 petty sessional divisions. The county borough of
Leicester has a separate court of quarter sessions and a separate
commission of the peace. There are 327 civil parishes. The county
is divided into four parliamentary divisions (Eastern or Melton,
Mid or Loughborough, Western or Bosworth, Southern or Harborough),
each returning one member; and the parliamentary
borough of Leicester returns 2 members. The county is in the
diocese of Peterborough, with the exception of small parts in those
of Southwell and Worcester; and contains 255 ecclesiastical parishes
or districts, wholly or in part.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The district which is now Leicestershire was reached
in the 6th century by Anglian invaders who, making their way
across the Trent, penetrated Charnwood Forest as far as Leicester,
the fall of which may be dated at about 556. In 679 the district
formed the kingdom of the Middle Angles within the kingdom
of Mercia, and on the subdivision of the Mercian see in that year
was formed into a separate bishopric having its see at Leicester.
In the 9th century the district was subjugated by the Danes, and
Leicester became one of the five Danish boroughs. It was recovered
by Æthelflaed in 918, but the Northmen regained their
supremacy shortly after, and the prevalence of Scandinavian
place-names in the county bears evidence of the extent of their
settlement.</p>

<p>Leicestershire probably originated as a shire in the 10th century,
and at the time of the Domesday Survey was divided into the
four wapentakes of Guthlaxton, Framland, Goscote and Gartree.
The Leicestershire Survey of the 12th century shows an additional
grouping of the vills into small local hundreds, manorial rather
than administrative divisions, which have completely disappeared.
In the reign of Edward I. the divisions appear as hundreds, and
in the reign of Edward III. the additional hundred of Sparkenhoe
was formed out of Guthlaxton. Before the 17th century Goscote
was divided into East and West Goscote, and since then the
hundreds have undergone little change. Until 1566 Leicestershire
and Warwickshire had a common sheriff, the shire-court for
the former being held at Leicester.</p>

<p>Leicestershire constituted an archdeaconry within the diocese
of Lincoln from 1092 until its transference to Peterborough in
1837. In 1291 it comprised the deaneries of Akeley, Leicester
(now Christianity), Framland, Gartree, Goscote, Guthlaxton and
Sparkenhoe. The deaneries remained unaltered until 1865.
Since 1894 they have been as follows: East, South and West
Akeley, Christianity, Framland (3 portions), Sparkenhoe (2
portions), Gartree (3 portions), Goscote (2 portions), Guthlaxton
(3 portions).</p>

<p>Among the earliest historical events connected with the
county were the siege and capture of Leicester by Henry II.
in 1173 on the rebellion of the earl of Leicester; the surrender
of Leicester to Prince Edward in 1264; and the parliament
held at Leicester in 1414. During the Wars of the Roses Leicester
was a great Lancastrian stronghold. In 1485 the battle of
Bosworth was fought in the county. In the Civil War of the
17th century the greater part of the county favoured the parliament,
though the mayor and some members of the corporation
of Leicester sided with the king, and in 1642 the citizens of
Leicester on a summons from Prince Rupert lent Charles £500.
In 1645 Leicester was twice captured by the Royalist forces.</p>

<p>Before the Conquest large estates in Leicestershire were held
by Earls Ralf, Morcar, Waltheof and Harold, but the Domesday
Survey of 1086 reveals an almost total displacement of English
by Norman landholders, only a few estates being retained by
Englishmen as under-tenants. The first lay-tenant mentioned
in the survey is Robert, count of Meulan, ancestor of the Beaumont
family and afterwards earl of Leicester, to whose fief was
afterwards annexed the vast holding of Hugh de Grantmesnil,
lord high steward of England. Robert de Toeni, another Domesday
tenant, founded Belvoir Castle and Priory. The fief of
Robert de Buci was bestowed on Richard Basset, founder of
Laund Abbey, in the reign of Henry I. Loughborough was an
ancient seat of the Despenser family, and Brookesby was the seat
of the Villiers and the birthplace of George Villiers, the famous
duke of Buckingham. Melton Mowbray was named from its
former lords, the Mowbrays, descendants of Nigel de Albini, the
founder of Axholme Priory. Lady Jane Grey was born at
Bradgate near Leicester, and Bishop Latimer was born at
Thurcaston.</p>

<p>The woollen industry flourished in Leicestershire in Norman
times, and in 1343 Leicestershire wool was rated at a higher
value than that of most other counties. Coal was worked at
Coleorton in the early 15th century and at Measham in the 17th
century. The famous blue slate of Swithland has been quarried
from time immemorial, and the limestone quarry at Barrow-on-Soar
is also of very ancient repute, the monks of the abbey of
St Mary de Pré formerly enjoying the tithe of its produce. The
staple manufacture of the county, that of hosiery, originated
in the 17th century, the chief centres being Leicester, Hinckley
and Loughborough, and before the development of steam-driven
frames in the 19th century hand framework knitting of hose and
gloves was carried on in about a hundred villages. Wool-carding
was also an extensive industry before 1840.</p>

<p>In 1290 Leicestershire returned two members to parliament,
and in 1295 Leicester was also represented by two members.
Under the Reform Act of 1832 the county returned four members
in two divisions until the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885,
under which it returned four members in four divisions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;Remains of monastic foundations are slight, though
there were a considerable number of these. There are traces of
Leicester Abbey and of Gracedieu near Coalville, while at Ulverscroft
in Charnwood, where there was an Augustinian priory of the
12th century, there are fine Decorated remains, including a tower.
The most noteworthy churches are found in the towns, as at Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
Hinckley, Leicester, Loughborough, Lutterworth,
Market Bosworth, Market Harborough, and Melton Mowbray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>
(<i>qq.v.</i>). The principal old castle is that of Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
while at Kirby Muxloe there is a picturesque fortified mansion of
Tudor date. There are several good Elizabethan mansions, as that
at Laund in the E. of the county. Among modern mansions that
of the dukes of Rutland, Belvoir Castle in the extreme N.E., is a
massive mansion of the early 19th century, finely placed on the
summit of a hill.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIDEN<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Leyden</span>, a city in the province of South Holland,
the kingdom of the Netherlands, on the Old Rhine, and a junction
station 18 m. by rail S.S.W. of Haarlem. It is connected by steam
tramway with Haarlem and The Hague respectively, and with
the seaside resorts of Katwyk and Noordwyk. There is also
regular steamboat connexion with Katwyk, Noordwyk, Amsterdam
and Gouda. The population of Leiden which, it is estimated,
reached 100,000 in 1640, had sunk to 30,000 between 1796 and
1811, and in 1904 was 56,044. The two branches of the Rhine
which enter Leiden on the east unite in the centre of the town,
which is further intersected by numerous small and sombre
canals, with tree-bordered quays and old houses. On the south
side of the town pleasant gardens extend along the old Singel,
or outer canal, and there is a large open space, the Van der Werf
Park, named after the burgomaster, Pieter Andriaanszoon van
der Werf, who defended the town against the Spaniards in 1574.
This open space was formed by the accidental explosion of a
powdership in 1807, hundreds of houses being demolished, including
that of the Elzevir family of printers. At the junction of the
two arms of the Rhine stands the old castle (De Burcht), a
circular tower built on an earthen mound. Its origin is unknown,
but some connect it with Roman days and others with the Saxon
Hengist. Of Leiden&rsquo;s old gateways only two&mdash;both dating from
the end of the 17th century&mdash;are standing. Of the numerous
churches the chief are the Hooglandsche Kerk, or the church
of St Pancras, built in the 15th century and restored in 1885-1902,
containing the monument of Pieter Andriaanszoon van der
Werf, and the Pieterskerk (1315) with monuments to Scaliger,
Boerhaave and other famous scholars. The most interesting
buildings are the town hall (Stadhuis), a fine example of 16th-century
Dutch building; the Gemeenlandshuis van Rynland
(1596, restored 1878); the weight-house built by Pieter Post
(1658); the former court-house, now a military storehouse;
and the ancient gymnasium (1599) and the so-called city timber-house
(Stads Timmerhuis) (1612), both built by Lieven de Key
(<i>c.</i> 1560-1627).</p>

<p>In spite of a certain industrial activity and the periodical
bustle of its cattle and dairy markets, Leiden remains essentially
an academic city. The university is a flourishing institution.
It was founded by William of Orange in 1575 as a reward for
the heroic defence of the previous year, the tradition being that
the citizens were offered the choice between a university and a
certain exemption from taxes. Originally located in the convent
of St Barbara, the university was removed in 1581 to the convent
of the White Nuns, the site of which it still occupies, though that
building was destroyed in 1616. The presence within half a
century of the date of its foundation of such scholars as Justus
Lipsius, Joseph Scaliger, Francis Gomarus, Hugo Grotius,
Jacobus Arminius, Daniel Heinsius and Guardas Johannes
Vossius at once raised Leiden university to the highest European
fame, a position which the learning and reputation of Jacobus
Gronovius, Hermann Boerhaave, Tiberius Hemsterhuis and
David Ruhnken, among others, enabled it to maintain down
to the end of the 18th century. The portraits of many famous
professors since the earliest days hang in the university <i>aula</i>, one
of the most memorable places, as Niebuhr called it, in the history
of science. The university library contains upwards of 190,000
volumes and 6000 MSS. and pamphlet portfolios, and is very rich
in Oriental and Greek MSS. and old Dutch travels. Among the
institutions connected with the university are the national
institution for East Indian languages, ethnology and geography;
the fine botanical gardens, founded in 1587; the observatory
(1860); the natural history museum, with a very complete
anatomical cabinet; the museum of antiquities (Museum van
Oudheden), with specially valuable Egyptian and Indian departments;
a museum of Dutch antiquities from the earliest times;
and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was
P. F. von Siebold&rsquo;s Japanese collections. The anatomical and
pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the
museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored. The
university has now five faculties, of which those of law and
medicine are the most celebrated, and is attended by about
1200 students.</p>

<p>The municipal museum, founded in 1869 and located in the
old cloth-hall (Laeckenhalle) (1640), contains a varied collection
of antiquities connected with Leiden, as well as some paintings
including works by the elder van Swanenburgh, Cornelius Engelbrechtszoon,
Lucas van Leiden and Jan Steen, who were all
natives of Leiden. Jan van Goyen, Gabriel Metsu, Gerard Dou
and Rembrandt were also natives of this town. There is also a
small collection of paintings in the Meermansburg. The Thysian
library occupies an old Renaissance building of the year 1655,
and is especially rich in legal works and native chronicles.
Noteworthy also are the collection of the Society of Dutch
Literature (1766); the collections of casts and of engravings;
the seamen&rsquo;s training school; the Remonstrant seminary,
transferred hither from Amsterdam in 1873; the two hospitals
(one of which is private); the house of correction; and the
court-house.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leiden is an ancient town, although it is not the <i>Lugdunum
Batavorum</i> of the Romans. Its early name was Leithen, and it was
governed until 1420 by burgraves, the representatives of the courts
of Holland. The most celebrated event in its history is its siege
by the Spaniards in 1574. Besieged from May until October, it was
at length relieved by the cutting of the dikes, thus enabling ships
to carry provisions to the inhabitants of the flooded town. The
weaving establishments (mainly broadcloth) of Leiden at the close
of the 15th century were very important, and after the expulsion of
the Spaniards Leiden cloth, Leiden baize and Leiden camlet were
familiar terms. These industries afterwards declined, and in the
beginning of the 19th century the baize manufacture was altogether
given up. Linen and woollen manufactures are now the most
important industries, while there is a considerable transit trade in
butter and cheese.</p>

<p>Katwyk, or Katwijk, 6 m. N.W. of Leiden, is a popular seaside
resort and fishing village. Close by are the great locks constructed
in 1807 by the engineer, F. W. Conrad (d. 1808), through which the
Rhine (here called the Katwyk canal) is admitted into the sea at low
tide. The shore and the entrance to the canal are strengthened by
huge dikes. In 1520 an ancient Roman camp known as the Brittenburg
was discovered here. It was square in shape, each side measuring
82 yds., and the remains stood about 10 ft. high. By the middle
of the 18th century it had been destroyed and covered by the sea.</p>

Hague, 1883); and for the siege see J. L. Motley, <i>The Rise of the
Dutch Republic</i> (1896).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIDY, JOSEPH<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1823-1891), American naturalist and
palaeontologist, was born in Philadelphia on the 9th of September
1823. He studied mineralogy and botany without an instructor,
and graduated in medicine at the university of Pennsylvania in
1844. Continuing his work in anatomy and physiology, he
visited Europe in 1848, but both before and after this period of
foreign study lectured and taught in American medical colleges.
In 1853 he was appointed professor of anatomy in the university
of Pennsylvania, paying special attention to comparative
anatomy. In 1884 he promoted the establishment in the same
institution of the department of biology, of which he became
director, and meanwhile taught natural history in Swarthmore
College, near Philadelphia. His papers on biology and palaeontology
were very numerous, covering both fauna and flora,
and ranging from microscopic forms of animal life to the higher
vertebrates. He wrote also occasional papers on minerals. He
was an active member of the Boston Society of Natural History
and of the American Philosophical Society; and was the recipient
of various American and foreign degrees and honours. His
<i>Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States</i> (1865) and <i>Contributions
to the Extinct Vertebrate Fauna of the Western Territories</i> (1873)
were the most important of his larger works; the best known
and most widely circulated was an <i>Elementary Treatise on Human</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
<i>Anatomy</i> (1860, afterwards revised in new editions). He died

<p><span class="bold">LEIF ERICSSON<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Leifr Eiriksson</span>] (fl. 999-1000), Scandinavian
explorer, of Icelandic family, the first known European
discoverer of &ldquo;Vinland,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vineland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wineland, the Good,&rdquo;
in North America. He was a son of Eric the Red (Eirikr hinn
raudi Thorvaldsson), the founder of the earliest Scandinavian
settlements&mdash;from Iceland&mdash;in Greenland (985). In 999 he
went from Greenland to the court of King Olaf Tryggvason in
Norway, stopping in the Hebrides on the way. On his departure
from Norway in 1000, the king commissioned him to proclaim
Christianity in Greenland. As on his outward voyage, Leif was
again driven far out of his course by contrary weather&mdash;this
time to lands (in America) &ldquo;of which he had previously had no
knowledge,&rdquo; where &ldquo;self-sown&rdquo; wheat grew, and vines, and
&ldquo;mösur&rdquo; (maple?) wood. Leif took specimens of all these,
and sailing away came home safely to his father&rsquo;s home in
Brattahlid on Ericsfiord in Greenland. On his voyage from this
Vineland to Greenland, Leif rescued some shipwrecked men,
and from this, and his discoveries, gained his name of &ldquo;The
Lucky&rdquo; (<i>hinn heppni</i>). On the subsequent expedition of
Thorfinn Karlsefni for the further exploration and settlement of
the Far Western vine-country, it is recorded that certain Gaels,
incredibly fleet of foot, who had been given to Leif by Olaf
Tryggvason, and whom Leif had offered to Thorfinn, were put
on shore to scout.</p>

<p>Such is the account of the <i>Saga of Eric the Red</i>, supported by
a number of briefer references in early Icelandic and other
literature. The less trustworthy history of the <i>Flatey Book</i>
makes Biarni Heriulfsson in 985 discover Helluland (Labrador?)
as well as other western lands which he does not explore, not
even permitting his men to land; while Leif Ericsson follows
up Biarni&rsquo;s discoveries, begins the exploration of Helluland,
Markland and Vinland, and realizes some of the charms of the
last named, where he winters. But this secondary authority
(the <i>Flatey Book</i> narrative), which till lately formed the basis
of all general knowledge as to Vinland, abounds in contradictions
and difficulties from which <i>Eric the Red Saga</i> is comparatively
free. Thus (in <i>Flatey</i>) the grapes of Vinland are found in winter
and gathered in spring; the man who first finds them, Leif&rsquo;s
foster-father Tyrker the German, gets drunk from eating the
fruit; and the vines themselves are spoken of as big trees affording
timber. Looking at the record in <i>Eric the Red Saga</i>, it would
seem probable that Leif&rsquo;s Vinland answers to some part of
southern Nova Scotia. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vinland</a></span>. (As to Helluland and
Markland see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Thorfinn Karlsefni</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The MSS. of <i>Eric the Red&rsquo;s Saga</i> are Nos. 544 and 557 of the
Arne-Magnaean collection in Copenhagen; the MS. of the <i>Flatey
Book</i>, so called because it was long the property of a family living on
Flat Island in Broad Firth (Flatey in Breiðafjord [B-eidafj-d]), on the
north-west coast of Iceland, was presented in 1662 to the Royal Library
of Denmark, of which it is still one of the chief treasures. These
leading narratives are supplemented by Adam of Bremen, <i>Gesta

was born at Shawell, Leicestershire. He was educated at
Magdalen Hall, Oxford, from 1616, and subsequently became
a member of the Middle Temple. In 1636 he entered parliament
as member for Stafford, and during the Civil War held a colonelcy
in the parliamentary army. He has sometimes been confounded
with John Ley (1583-1662), and so represented as having sat
in the Westminster Assembly. The public career of Leigh terminated
with his expulsion from parliament with the rest of
the Presbyterian party in 1648. From an early age he had
studied theology and produced numerous compilations, the most
important being the <i>Critica Sacra, containing Observations on
all the Radices of the Hebrew Words of the Old and the Greek of the
New Testament</i> (1639-1644; new ed., with supplement, 1662),
for which the author received the thanks of the Westminster
Assembly, to whom it was dedicated. His other works include
<i>Select and Choice Observations concerning the First Twelve Caesars</i>

<p><span class="bold">LEIGH,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in the Leigh
parliamentary division of Lancashire, England, 11 m. W. by
N. from Manchester by the London &amp; North-Western railway.
Pop. (1891) 30,882, (1901) 40,001. The ancient parish church
of St Mary the Virgin was, with the exception of the tower,
rebuilt in 1873 in the Perpendicular style. The grammar school,
the date of whose foundation is unknown, received its principal
endowments in 1655, 1662 and 1681. The staple manufactures
are silk and cotton; there are also glass works, foundries,
breweries, and flour mills, with extensive collieries. Though the
neighbourhood is principally an industrial district, several fine
old houses are left near Leigh. The town was incorporated
in 1899, and the corporation consists of a mayor, 8 aldermen and
24 councillors. Area, 6358 acres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIGHTON, FREDERICK LEIGHTON,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1830-1896),
English painter and sculptor, the son of a physician, was born
at Scarborough on the 3rd of December 1830. His grandfather,
Sir James Leighton, also a physician, was long resident at the
court of St Petersburg. Frederick Leighton was taken abroad
at a very early age. In 1840 he learnt drawing at Rome under
Signor Meli. The family moved to Dresden and Berlin, where he
attended classes at the Academy. In 1843 he was sent to school
at Frankfort, and in the winter of 1844 accompanied his family
to Florence, where his future career as an artist was decided.
There he studied under Bezzuoli and Segnolini at the Accademia
delle Belle Arti, and attended anatomy classes under Zanetti;
but he soon returned to complete his general education at Frankfort,
receiving no further direct instruction in art for five years.
He went to Brussels in 1848, where he met Wiertz and Gallait,
and painted some pictures, including &ldquo;Cimabue finding Giotto,&rdquo;
and a portrait of himself. In 1849 he studied for a few months
in Paris, where he copied Titian and Correggio in the Louvre, and
then returned to Frankfort, where he settled down to serious
art work under Edward Steinle, whose pupil he declared he was
&ldquo;in the fullest sense of the term.&rdquo; Though his artistic training
was mainly German, and his master belonged to the same school
as Cornelius and Overbeck, he loved Italian art and Italy and
the first picture by which he became known to the British public
was &ldquo;Cimabue&rsquo;s Madonna carried in Procession through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
Streets of Florence,&rdquo; which appeared at the Royal Academy
in 1855. At this time the works of the Pre-Raphaelites almost
absorbed public interest in art&mdash;it was the year of Holman Hunt&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Light of the World,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Rescue,&rdquo; by Millais. Yet
Leighton&rsquo;s picture, painted in quite a different style, created a
sensation, and was purchased by Queen Victoria. Although,
since his infancy, he had only visited England once (in 1851, when
he came to see the Great Exhibition), he was not quite unknown
in the cultured and artistic world of London, as he had made
many friends during a residence in Rome of some two years
or more after he left Frankfort in 1852. Amongst these were
Giovanni Costa, Robert Browning, James Knowles, George
Mason and Sir Edward Poynter, then a youth, whom he allowed
to work in his studio. He also met Thackeray, who wrote from
Rome to the young Millais: &ldquo;Here is a versatile young dog,
who will run you close for the presidentship one of these days.&rdquo;
During these years he painted several Florentine subjects&mdash;&ldquo;Tybalt
and Romeo,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Death of Brunelleschi,&rdquo; a cartoon
of &ldquo;The Pest in Florence according to Boccaccio,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Reconciliation of the Montagues and the Capulets.&rdquo; He now
turned his attention to themes of classic legend, which at first
he treated in a &ldquo;Romantic spirit.&rdquo; His next picture, exhibited in
1856, was &ldquo;The Triumph of Music: Orpheus by the Power of his
Art redeems his Wife from Hades.&rdquo; It was not a success, and
he did not again exhibit till 1858, when he sent a little picture
of &ldquo;The Fisherman and the Syren&rdquo; to the Royal Academy, and
&ldquo;Samson and Delilah&rdquo; to the Society of British Artists in
Suffolk Street. In 1858 he visited London and made the acquaintance
of the leading Pre-Raphaelites&mdash;Rossetti, Holman Hunt and
Millais. In the spring of 1859 he was at Capri, always a favourite
resort of his, and made many studies from nature, including a
very famous drawing of a lemon tree. It was not till 1860 that
he settled in London, when he took up his quarters at 2 Orme
Square, Bayswater, where he stayed till, in 1860, he moved to
his celebrated house in Holland Park Road, with its Arab hall
decorated with Damascus tiles. There he lived till his death.
He now began to fulfil the promise of his &ldquo;Cimabue,&rdquo; and by such
pictures as &ldquo;Paolo e Francesca,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Star of Bethlehem,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jezebel and Ahab taking Possession of Naboth&rsquo;s Vineyard,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Michael Angelo musing over his Dying Servant,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Girl
feeding Peacocks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Odalisque,&rdquo; all exhibited in 1861-1863,
rose rapidly to the head of his profession. The two latter
pictures were marked by the rhythm of line and luxury of colour
which are among the most constant attributes of his art, and may
be regarded as his first dreams of Oriental beauty, with which
he afterwards showed so great a sympathy. In 1864 he exhibited
&ldquo;Dante in Exile&rdquo; (the greatest of his Italian pictures), &ldquo;Orpheus
and Eurydice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Golden Hours.&rdquo; In the winter of the same
year he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. After
this the main effort of his life was to realize visions of beauty
suggested by classic myth and history. If we add to pictures of
this class a few Scriptural subjects, a few Oriental dreams, one
or two of tender sentiment like &ldquo;Wedded&rdquo; (one of the most
popular of his pictures, and well known by not only an engraving,
but a statuette modelled by an Italian sculptor), a number of
studies of very various types of female beauty, &ldquo;Teresina,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Biondina,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bianca,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moretta,&rdquo; &amp;c., and an occasional
portrait, we shall nearly exhaust the two classes into which Lord
Leighton&rsquo;s work (as a painter) can be divided.</p>

<p>Amongst the finest of his classical pictures were&mdash;&ldquo;Syracusan
Bride leading Wild Beasts in Procession to the Temple of Diana&rdquo;
(1866), &ldquo;Venus disrobing for the Bath&rdquo; (1867), &ldquo;Electra at the
Tomb of Agamemnon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Helios and Rhodos&rdquo; (1869),
&ldquo;Hercules wrestling with Death for the Body of Alcestis&rdquo;
(1871), &ldquo;Clytemnestra&rdquo; (1874), &ldquo;The Daphnephoria&rdquo; (1876),
&ldquo;Nausicaa&rdquo; (1878), &ldquo;An Idyll&rdquo; (1881), two lovers under a
spreading oak listening to the piping of a shepherd and gazing
on the rich plain below; &ldquo;Phryne&rdquo; (1882), a nude figure standing
in the sun; &ldquo;Cymon and Iphigenia&rdquo; (1884), &ldquo;Captive
Andromache&rdquo; (1888), now in the Manchester Art Gallery; with
the &ldquo;Last Watch of Hero&rdquo; (1887), &ldquo;The Bath of Psyche&rdquo;
(1890), now in the Chantrey Bequest collection; &ldquo;The Garden
of the Hesperides&rdquo; (1892), &ldquo;Perseus and Andromeda&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Return of Persephone,&rdquo; now in the Leeds Gallery (1891); and
&ldquo;Clytie,&rdquo; his last work (1896). All these pictures are characterized
by nobility of conception, by almost perfect draughtsmanship,
by colour which, if not of the highest quality, is always
original, choice and effective. They often reach distinction and
dignity of attitude and gesture, and occasionally, as in the
&ldquo;Hercules and Death,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Electra&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Clytemnestra,&rdquo;
a noble intensity of feeling. Perhaps, amidst the great variety of
qualities which they possess, none is more universal and more
characteristic than a rich elegance, combined with an almost
fastidious selection of beautiful forms. It is the super-eminence
of these qualities, associated with great decorative skill, that
make the splendid pageant of the &ldquo;Daphnephoria&rdquo; the most
perfect expression of his individual genius. Here we have his composition,
his colour, his sense of the joy and movement of life,
his love of art and nature at their purest and most spontaneous,
and the result is a work without a rival of its kind in the British
School.</p>

<p>Leighton was one of the most thorough draughtsmen of his
day. His sketches and studies for his pictures are numerous
and very highly esteemed. They contain the essence of his
conceptions, and much of their spiritual beauty and subtlety
of expression was often lost in the elaboration of the finished
picture. He seldom succeeded in retaining the freshness of
his first idea more completely than in his last picture&mdash;&ldquo;Clytie&rdquo;&mdash;which
was left unfinished on his easel. He rarely painted
sacred subjects. The most beautiful of his few pictures of this
kind was the &ldquo;David musing on the Housetop&rdquo; (1865). Others
were &ldquo;Elijah in the Wilderness&rdquo; (1879), &ldquo;Elisha raising the
Son of the Shunammite&rdquo; (1881) and a design intended for the
decoration of the dome of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, &ldquo;And the Sea
gave up the Dead which were in it&rdquo; (1892), now in the Tate
Gallery, and the terrible &ldquo;Rizpah&rdquo; of 1893. His diploma
picture was &ldquo;St Jerome,&rdquo; exhibited in 1869. Besides these
pictures of sacred subjects, he made some designs for Dalziel&rsquo;s
Bible, which for force of imagination excel the paintings. The
finest of these are &ldquo;Cain and Abel,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Samson with the
Gates of Gaza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not so easily to be classed, but among the most individual
and beautiful of his pictures, are a few of which the motive was
purely aesthetic. Amongst these may specially be noted &ldquo;The
Summer Moon,&rdquo; two Greek girls sleeping on a marble bench,
and &ldquo;The Music Lesson,&rdquo; in which a lovely little girl is seated
on her lovely young mother&rsquo;s lap learning to play the lute. With
these, as a work produced without any literary suggestion,
though very different in feeling, may be associated the &ldquo;Eastern
Slinger scaring Birds in the Harvest-time: Moon-rise&rdquo; (1875),
a nude figure standing on a raised platform in a field of wheat.</p>

<p>Leighton also painted a few portraits, including those of
Signor Costa, the Italian landscape painter, Mr F. P. Cockerell,
Mrs Sutherland Orr (his sister), Amy, Lady Coleridge, Mrs
Stephen Ralli and (the finest of all) Sir Richard Burton, the
traveller and Eastern scholar, which was exhibited in 1876 and
is now in the National Portrait Gallery.</p>

<p>Like other painters of the day, notably G. F. Watts, Lord
Leighton executed a few pieces of sculpture. His &ldquo;Athlete
struggling with a Python&rdquo; was exhibited at the Royal Academy
in 1877, and was purchased for the Chantrey Bequest collection.
Another statue, &ldquo;The Sluggard,&rdquo; of equal merit, was exhibited
in 1886; and a charming statuette of a nude figure of a girl
looking over her shoulder at a frog, called &ldquo;Needless Alarms,&rdquo;
was completed in the same year, and presented by the artist
to Sir John Millais in acknowledgment of the gift by the latter
of his picture, &ldquo;Shelling Peas.&rdquo; He made the beautiful design
for the reverse of the Jubilee Medal of 1887. It was also his
habit to make sketch models in wax for the figures in his pictures,
many of which are in the possession of the Royal Academy.
As an illustrator in black and white he also deserves to be remembered,
especially for the cuts to Dalziel&rsquo;s Bible, already mentioned,
and his illustrations to George Eliot&rsquo;s <i>Romola</i>, which appeared
in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>. The latter are full of the spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
Florence and the Florentines, and show a keen sense of humour,
elsewhere excluded from his work. Of his decorative paintings,
the best known are the elegant compositions (in spirit fresco)
on the walls of the Victoria and Albert Museum, representing
&ldquo;The Industrial Arts of War and Peace.&rdquo; There, also, is the
refined and spirited figure of &ldquo;Cimabue&rdquo; in mosaic. In Lyndhurst
church are mural decorations to the memory of Mr Pepys
Cockerell, illustrating &ldquo;The Parable of the Wise and Foolish
Virgins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leighton&rsquo;s life was throughout marked by distinction, artistic
and social. Though not tall, he had a fine presence and manners,
at once genial and courtly. He was welcomed in all societies,
from the palace to the studio. He spoke German, Italian and
French, as well as English. He had much taste and love for
music, and considerable gifts as an orator of a florid type. His
Presidential Discourses (published, London, 1896) were full
of elegance and culture. For seven years (1876-1883) he commanded
the 20th Middlesex (Artists) Rifle Volunteers, retiring
with the rank of honorary colonel, and subsequently receiving
the Volunteer Decoration. Yet no social attractions or successes
diverted him from his devotion to his profession, the welfare
of his brethren in art or of the Royal Academy. As president
he was punctilious in the discharge of his duties, ready to give
help and encouragement to artists young and old, and his tenure
of the office was marked by some wise and liberal reforms. He
frequently went abroad, generally to Italy, where he was well
known and appreciated. He visited Spain in 1866, Egypt in
1868, when he went up the Nile with Ferdinand de Lesseps
in a steamer lent by the Khedive. He was at Damascus for a
short time in 1873. It was his custom on all these trips to make
little lively sketches of landscape and buildings. These fresh
little flowers of his leisure used to decorate the walls of his studio,
and at the sale of its contents after his death realized considerable
prices. It was when he was in the full tide of his popularity
and success, and apparently in the full tide of his personal vigour
also, that he was struck with <i>angina pectoris</i>. For a long time
he struggled bravely with this cruel disease, never omitting
except from absolute necessity any of his official duties except
during a brief period of rest abroad, which failed to produce
the desired effect. His death occurred on the 25th of January
1896.</p>

<p>Leighton was elected an Academician in 1868, and succeeded
Sir Francis Grant as President in 1878, when he was knighted.
He was created a baronet in 1886, and was raised to the peerage
in 1896, a few days before his death. He held honorary degrees
at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Edinburgh
and Durham, was an Associate of the Institute of France; a
Commander of the Legion of Honour, and of the Order of
Leopold. He was a Knight of the Coburg Order, &ldquo;Dem Verdienste,&rdquo;
and of the Prussian Order, &ldquo;Pour le Mérite,&rdquo; and a
member of at least ten foreign Academies. In 1859 he won a
medal of the second class at the Paris Salon, and at the Exposition
Universelle of 1889 a gold medal. As a sculptor he was
awarded a medal of the first class in 1878 and the Grand Prix
in 1889.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIGHTON, ROBERT<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (1611-1684), archbishop of Glasgow,
was born, probably in London (others say at Ulishaven, Forfarshire),
in 1611, the eldest son of Dr Alexander Leighton, the
author of <i>Zion&rsquo;s Plea against the Prelacie</i>, whose terrible sufferings
for having dared to question the divine right of Episcopacy,
under the persecution of Laud, form one of the most disgraceful
incidents of the reign of Charles I. Dr Leighton is said to have
been of the old family of Ulishaven in Forfarshire. From his
earliest childhood, according to Burnet, Robert Leighton was
distinguished for his saintly disposition. In his sixteenth year
(1627) he was sent to the university of Edinburgh, where, after
studying with distinguished success for four years, he took the
degree of M.A. in 1631. His father then sent him to travel
abroad, and he is understood to have spent several years in
France, where he acquired a complete mastery of the French
language. While there he passed a good deal of time with
relatives at Douai who had become Roman Catholics, and with
whom he kept up a correspondence for many years afterwards.
Either at this time or on some subsequent visit he had also a
good deal of intercourse with members of the Jansenist party.
This intercourse contributed to the charity towards those who
differed from him in religious opinion, which ever afterwards
formed a feature in his character. The exact period of his
return to Scotland has not been ascertained; but in 1641 he
was ordained Presbyterian minister of Newbattle in Midlothian.
In 1652 he resigned his charge and went to reside in Edinburgh.
What led him to take this step does not distinctly appear.
The account given is that he had little sympathy with the fiery
zeal of his brother clergymen on certain political questions, and
that this led to severe censures on their part.</p>

<p>Early in 1653 he was appointed principal of the university
of Edinburgh, and primarius professor of divinity. In this post
he continued for seven or eight years. A considerable number
of his Latin prelections and other addresses (published after
his death) are remarkable for the purity and elegance of their
Latinity, and their subdued and meditative eloquence. They are
valuable instructions in the art of living a holy life rather than
a body of scientific divinity. Throughout, however, they bear
the marks of a deeply learned and accomplished mind, saturated
with both classical and patristic reading, and like all his works
they breathe the spirit of one who lived very much above the
world. His mental temper was too unlike the temper of his time
to secure success as a teacher.</p>

<p>In 1661, when Charles II. had resolved to force Episcopacy
once more upon Scotland, he fixed upon Leighton for one of his
bishops (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Scotland, Church of</a></span>). Leighton, living very much
out of the world, and being somewhat deficient in what may be
called the political sense, was too open to the persuasions used
to induce him to enter a sphere for which he instinctively felt
he was ill qualified. The Episcopacy which he contemplated
was that modified form which had been suggested by Archbishop
Ussher, and to which Baxter and many of the best of the English
Nonconformists would have readily given their adherence. It
is significant that he always refused to be addressed as &ldquo;my
lord,&rdquo; and it is stated that when dining with his clergy on one
occasion he wished to seat himself at the foot of the table.</p>

<p>Leighton soon began to discover the sort of men with whom
he was to be associated in the episcopate. He travelled with
them in the same coach from London towards Scotland, but
having become, as he told Burnet, very weary of their company
(as he doubted not they were of his), and having found that
they intended to make a kind of triumphal entrance into
Edinburgh, he left them at Morpeth and retired to the earl of
Lothian&rsquo;s at Newbattle. He very soon lost all hope of being
able to build up the church by the means which the government
had set on foot, and his work, as he confessed to Burnet, &ldquo;seemed
to him a fighting against God.&rdquo; He did, however, what he could,
governing his diocese (that of Dunblane) with the utmost
mildness, as far as he could, preventing the persecuting measures
in active operation elsewhere, and endeavouring to persuade
the Presbyterian clergy to come to an accommodation with their
Episcopal brethren. After a hopeless struggle of three or four
years to induce the government to put a stop to their fierce
persecution of the Covenanters, he determined to resign his
bishopric, and went up to London in 1665 for this purpose.
He so far worked upon the mind of Charles that he promised
to enforce the adoption of milder measures, but it does not appear
that any material improvement took place. In 1669 Leighton
again went to London and made fresh representations on the
subject, but little result followed. The slight disposition,
however, shown by the government to accommodate matters
appears to have inspired Leighton with so much hope that in
the following year he agreed, though with a good deal of hesitation,
to accept the archbishopric of Glasgow. In this higher sphere
he redoubled his efforts with the Presbyterians to bring about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span>
some degree of conciliation with Episcopacy, but the only result
was to embroil himself with the hot-headed Episcopal party
as well as with the Presbyterians. In utter despair, therefore,
of being able to be of any further service to the cause of religion,
he resigned the archbishopric in 1674 and retired to the house
of his widowed sister, Mrs Lightmaker, at Broadhurst in Sussex.
Here he spent the remaining ten years, probably the happiest
of his life, and died suddenly on a visit to London in 1684.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is difficult to form a just or at least a full estimate of Leighton&rsquo;s
character. He stands almost alone in his age. In some respects
he was immeasurably superior both in intellect and in piety to most
of the Scottish ecclesiastics of his time; and yet he seems to have
had almost no influence in moulding the characters or conduct of
his contemporaries. So intense was his absorption in the love of
God that little room seems to have been left in his heart for human
sympathy or affection. Can it be that there was after all something
to repel in his outward manner? Burnet tells us that he had never
seen him laugh, and very seldom even smile. In other respects,
too, he gives the impression of standing aloof from human interests
and ties. It may go for little that he never married, but it was
surely a curious idiosyncrasy that he habitually cherished the wish
(which was granted him) that he might die in an inn. In fact, holy
meditation seems to have been the one absorbing interest of his life.
At Dunblane tradition preserved the memory of &ldquo;the good bishop,&rdquo;
silent and companionless, pacing up and down the sloping walk
by the river&rsquo;s bank under the beautiful west window of his cathedral.
And from a letter of the earl of Lothian to his countess it appears
that, whatever other reasons Leighton might have had for resigning
his charge at Newbattle, the main object which he had in view
was to be left to his own thoughts. It is therefore not very wonderful
that he was completely misjudged and even disliked both by the
Presbyterian and by the Episcopal party.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of him that he could never be made to
understand that anything which he wrote possessed the smallest
value. None of his works were published by himself, and it is stated
that he left orders that all his MSS. should be destroyed after his
death. But fortunately for the world this charge was disregarded.
Like all the best writing, it seems to flow without effort; it is the
easy unaffected outcome of his saintly nature. Throughout, however,
it is the language of a scholar and a man of perfect literary
taste; and with all its spirituality of thought there are no mystical
raptures, such as are often found mingled with the Scottish practical
theology of the 17th century. It was a common reproach against
Leighton that he had leanings towards Roman Catholicism, and
perhaps this is so far true that he had formed himself in some degree
upon the model of some of the saintly persons of that faith, such as
Pascal and Thomas à Kempis.</p>

<p>The best account of Leighton&rsquo;s character is that of Bishop Burnet
in <i>Hist. of his Own Times</i> (1723-1734). No perfectly satisfactory
edition of Leighton&rsquo;s works exists. After his death his <i>Commentary
on Peter</i> and several of his other works were published under the
editorship of his friend Dr Fall, and those early editions may be
said to be, with some drawbacks, by far the best. His later editors
have been possessed by the mania of reducing his good archaic and
nervous language to the bald feebleness of modern phraseology. It
is unfortunately impossible to exempt from this criticism even the
edition, in other respects very valuable and meritorious, published
under the superintendence of the Rev. W. West (7 vols., London,
1869-1875); see also volume of selections (with biography) by Dr
Blair of Dunblane (1883), who also contributed &ldquo;Bibliography of
Archbishop Leighton&rdquo; to the <i>British and Foreign Evangelical Review</i>
(July 1883); Andrew Lang, <i>History of Scotland</i> (1902).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIGHTON BUZZARD,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> a market town in the southern parliamentary
division of Bedfordshire, England, 40 m. N.W. of London
by the London &amp; North-Western railway. Pop. of urban district
(1901) 6331. It lies in the flat valley of the Ouzel, a tributary
of the Ouse, sheltered to east and west by low hills. The river
here forms the county boundary with Buckinghamshire. The
Grand Junction canal follows its course, and gives the town
extensive water-communications. The church of All Saints
is cruciform, with central tower and spire. It is mainly Early
English, and a fine example of the style; but some of the windows
including the nave clerestory, and the beautiful carved wooden
roof, are Perpendicular. The west door has good early iron-work;
and on one of the tower-arch pillars are some remarkable
early carvings of jocular character, one of which represents a
man assaulted by a woman with a ladle. The market cross is
of the 14th century, much restored, having an open arcade
supporting a pinnacle, with flying buttresses. The statues in
its niches are modern, but the originals are placed on the exterior
of the town hall. Leighton has a considerable agricultural
trade, and some industry in straw-plaiting. Across the Ouzel in
Buckinghamshire, where Leighton railway station is situated,
is the urban district of Linslade (pop. 2157).</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEININGEN,<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> the name of an old German family, whose lands
lay principally in Alsace and Lorraine. The first count of
Leiningen about whom anything certain is known was a certain
Emicho (d. 1117), whose family became extinct in the male
line when Count Frederick, a Minnesinger, died about 1220.
Frederick&rsquo;s sister, Liutgarde, married Simon, count of Saarbrücken,
and Frederick, one of their sons, inheriting the lands
of the counts of Leiningen, took their arms and their name.
Having increased its possessions the Leiningen family was
divided about 1317 into two branches; the elder of these, whose
head was a landgrave, died out in 1467. On this event its lands
fell to a female, the last landgrave&rsquo;s sister Margaret, wife of
Reinhard, lord of Westerburg, and their descendants were known
as the family of Leiningen-Westerburg. Later this family was
divided into two branches, those of Alt-Leiningen-Westerburg
and Neu-Leiningen-Westerburg, both of which are represented
to-day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the younger branch of the Leiningens, known
as the family of Leiningen-Dagsburg, was flourishing, and in
1560 this was divided into the lines of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hartenburg,
founded by Count John Philip (d. 1562), and
Leiningen-Dagsburg-Heidesheim or Falkenburg, founded by
Count Emicho (d. 1593). In 1779 the head of the former line
was raised to the rank of a prince of the Empire. In 1801 this
family was deprived of its lands on the left bank of the Rhine
by France, but in 1803 it received ample compensation for these
losses. A few years later its possessions were mediatized, and
they are now included mainly in Baden, but partly in Bavaria
and in Hesse. A former head of this family, Prince Emich
Charles, married Maria Louisa Victoria, princess of Saxe-Coburg;
after his death in 1814 the princess married George III.&rsquo;s son,
the duke of Kent, by whom she became the mother of Queen
Victoria. In 1910 the head of the family was Prince Emich
(b. 1866).</p>

<p>The family of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Heidesheim was divided
into three branches, the two senior of which became extinct
during the 18th century. At present it is represented by the
counts of Leiningen-Guntersblum and Leiningen-Heidesheim,
called also Leiningen-Billigheim and Leiningen-Neidenau.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEINSTER,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> a province of Ireland, occupying the middle and
south-eastern portion of the island, and extending to the left
bank of the Shannon. It includes counties Longford, Westmeath,
Meath, Louth, King&rsquo;s County, Kildare, Dublin, Queen&rsquo;s
County, Carlow, Wicklow, Kilkenny and Wexford (<i>q.v.</i> for
topography, &amp;c.). Leinster (<i>Laighen</i>) was one of the early
Milesian provinces of Ireland. Meath, the modern county of
which is included in Leinster, was the name of a separate province
created in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> The kings of Leinster retained
their position until 1171, and their descendants maintained
independence within a circumscribed territory as late as the 16th
century. In 1170 Richard Strongbow married Aoife, daughter
of the last king Diarmid, and thus acquired the nominal right to
the kingdom of Leinster. Henry II. confirmed him in powers
of jurisdiction equivalent to those of a palatinate. His daughter
Isabel married William Marshal, earl of Pembroke. Their five
daughters shared the territory of Leinster, which was now divided
into five liberties carrying the same extensive privileges as
the undivided territory, namely, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford,
Kildare and Leix. The history of Leinster thereafter passes
to the several divisions which were gradually organized into the
present counties.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIPZIG,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a city of Germany, the second town of the kingdom
of Saxony in size and the first in commercial importance, 70 m.
N.W. of Dresden and 111 m. S.W. of Berlin by rail, and 6 m.
from the Prussian frontier. It lies 350 ft. above the sea-level,
In a broad and fertile plain, just above the junction of three
small rivers, the Pleisse, the Parthe and the Elster, which flow
in various branches through or round the town and afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
under the name of the Elster, discharge themselves into the
Saale. The climate, though not generally unhealthy, may be
inclement in winter and hot in summer.</p>

<p>Leipzig is one of the most enterprising and prosperous of
German towns, and in point of trade and industries ranks among
German cities immediately after Berlin and Hamburg. It
possesses the third largest German university, is the seat of the
supreme tribunal of the German empire and the headquarters
of the XIX. (Saxon) army corps, and forms one of the most
prominent literary and musical centres in Europe. Its general
aspect is imposing, owing to the number of new public buildings
erected during the last 20 years of the 19th century. It consists
of the old, or inner city, surrounded by a wide and pleasant
promenade laid out on the site of the old fortifications, and of
the very much more extensive inner and outer suburbs. Many
thriving suburban villages, such as Reudnitz, Volkmarsdorf,
Gohlis, Eutritzsch, Plagwitz and Lindenau, have been incorporated
with the city, and with these accretions the population in
1905 amounted to 502,570. On the north-west the town is
bordered by the fine public park and woods of the Rosenthal,
and on the west by the Johanna Park and by pleasant groves
leading along the banks of the Pleisse.</p>

<p>The old town, with its narrow streets and numerous houses
of the 16th and 17th centuries, with their high-pitched roofs,
preserves much of its quaint medieval aspect. The market square,
lying almost in its centre, is of great interest. Upon it the four
main business streets, the Grimmaische-, the Peters-, the Hain- and
the Katharinen-strassen, converge, and its north side is
occupied by the beautiful old Rathaus, a Gothic edifice built by
the burgomaster Hieronymus Lotter in 1556, and containing
life-size portraits of the Saxon rulers. Superseded by the new
Rathaus, it has been restored and accommodates a municipal
museum. Behind the market square and the main street lie a
labyrinth of narrow streets interconnected by covered courtyards
and alleys, with extensive warehouses and cellars. The whole,
in the time of the great fairs, when every available place is packed
with merchandise and thronged with a motley crowd, presents
the semblance of an oriental bazaar. Close to the old Rathaus is
Auerbach&rsquo;s <i>Hof</i>, built about 1530 and interesting as being immortalized
in Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>. It has a curious old wine vault
(Keller) which contains a series of mural paintings of the 16th
century, representing the legend on which the play is based.
Near by is the picturesque Königshaus, for several centuries
the palace of the Saxon monarchs in Leipzig and in which King
Frederick Augustus I. was made prisoner by the Allies after the
battle of Leipzig in October 1813. At the end of the Petersstrasse,
in the south-west corner of the inner town and on the promenade,
lay the Pleissenburg, or citadel, modelled, according to tradition,
on that of Milan, and built early in the 13th century. Here
Luther in 1519 held his momentous disputation. The round
tower was long used as an observatory and the building as a
barrack. With the exception of the tower, which has been
encased and raised to double its former height&mdash;to 300 ft.&mdash;the
citadel has been removed and its site is occupied by the majestic
pile of the new Rathaus in Renaissance style, with the tower as
its central feature. The business of Leipzig is chiefly concentrated
in the inner city, but the headquarters of the book trade
lie in the eastern suburb. Between the inner town and the
latter lies the magnificent Augustusplatz, one of the most
spacious squares in Europe. Upon it, on the side of the inner
town and included within it, is the Augusteum, or main building
of the university, a handsome edifice containing a splendid hall
(1900), lecture rooms and archaeological collections; adjoining
it is the Paulinerkirche, the university church. The other sides
of the square are occupied by the new theatre, an imposing
Renaissance structure, designed by C. F. Langhans, the post
office and the museum of sculpture and painting, the latter faced
by the Mende fountain. The churches of Leipzig are comparatively
uninteresting. The oldest, in its present form, is the Paulinerkirche,
built in 1229-1240, and restored in 1900, with a
curiously grooved cloister; the largest in the inner town is the
Thomaskirche, with a high-pitched roof dating from 1496, and
memorable for its association with J. Sebastian Bach, who was
organist here. Among others may be mentioned the new Gothic
Petrikirche, with a lofty spire, in the south suburb. On the
east is the Johanniskirche, round which raged the last conflict
in the battle of 1813, when it suffered severely from cannon shot.
In it is the tomb of Bach, and outside that of the poet Gellert.
Opposite its main entrance is the Reformation monument, with
bronze statues of Luther and Melanchthon, by Johann Schilling,
unveiled in 1883. In the Johanna Park is the Lutherkirche
(1886), and close at hand the Roman Catholic and English
churches. To the south-west of the new Rathaus, lying beyond
the Pleisse and between it and the Johanna Park, is the new
academic quarter. Along the fine thoroughfares, noticeable
among which is the Karl Tauchnitz Strasse, are closely grouped
many striking buildings. Here is the new Gewandhaus, or
Konzerthaus, built in 1880-1884, in which the famous concerts
called after its name are given, the old Gewandhaus, or Drapers&rsquo;
Hall, in the inner town having again been devoted to commercial
use as a market hall during the fairs. Immediately opposite to
it is the new university library, built in 1891, removed hither
from the old monasterial buildings behind the Augusteum, and
containing some 500,000 volumes and 5000 MSS. Behind that
again is the academy of art, one wing of which accommodates
the industrial art school; and close beside it are the school of
technical arts and the conservatoire of music. Between the
university library and the new Gewandhaus stands a monument
of Mendelssohn (1892). Immediately to the east of the school
of arts rises the grand pile of the supreme tribunal of the German
empire, the Reichsgericht, which compares with the Reichstag
building in Berlin. It was built in 1888-1895 from plans by
Ludwig Hoffmann, and is distinguished for the symmetry and
harmony of its proportions. It bears an imposing dome, 225 ft.
high, crowned by a bronze figure of Truth by O. Lessing, 18 ft.
high. Opposite, on the outer side of the Pleisse, are the district
law-courts, large and substantial, though not specially imposing
edifices. In the same quarter stands the Grassi Museum (1893-1896)
for industrial art and ethnology, and a short distance away
are the palatial buildings of the Reichs and Deutsche Banks.
Farther east and lying in the centre of the book-trade quarter
stand close together the Buchhändlerhaus (booksellers&rsquo; exchange),
the great hall decorated with allegorical pictures by Sascha
Schneider, and the Buchgewerbehaus, a museum of the book
trade, both handsome red brick edifices in the German Renaissance
style, erected in 1886-1890. South-west of these buildings,
on the other side of the Johannisthal Park, are clustered the
medical institutes and hospitals of the university&mdash;the infirmary,
clinical and other hospitals, the physico-chemical institute,
pathological institute, physiological institute, ophthalmic
hospital, pharmacological institute, the schools of anatomy,
the chemical laboratory, the zoological institute, the physico-mineralogical
institute, the botanical garden and also the
veterinary schools, deaf and dumb asylum, agricultural college
and astronomical observatory. Among other noteworthy
buildings in this quarter must be noted the Johannisstift, an
asylum for the relief of the aged poor, with a handsome front
and slender spire. On the north side of the inner town and on
the promenade are the handsome exchange with library, and the
reformed church, a pleasing edifice in late Gothic.</p>

<p>Leipzig has some interesting monuments; the Siegesdenkmal,
commemorative of the wars of 1866 and 1870, on the market
square, statues of Goethe, Leibnitz, Gellert, J. Sebastian
Bach, Robert Schumann, Hahnemann, the homeopathist, and
Bismarck. There are also many memorials of the battle of
Leipzig, including an obelisk on the Randstädter-Steinweg, on the
site of the bridge which was prematurely blown up, when Prince
Poniatowski was drowned; a monument of cannon balls collected
after the battle; a &ldquo;relief&rdquo; to Major Friccius, who stormed
the outer Grimma gate; while on the battle plain itself and
close to &ldquo;Napoleonstein,&rdquo; which commemorates Napoleon&rsquo;s
position on the last day of the battle, a gigantic obelisk surrounded
by a garden has been planned for dedication on the
hundredth anniversary of the battle (October 19, 1913).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span></p>

<p><i>The University and Education.</i>&mdash;The university of Leipzig,
founded in 1409 by a secession of four hundred German students
from Prague, is one of the most influential universities in the
world. It was a few years since the most numerously attended
of any university in Germany, but it has since been outstripped
by those of Berlin and of Munich. Its large revenues, derived
to a great extent from house property in Leipzig and estates in
Saxony, enable it, in conjunction with a handsome state subvention,
to provide rich endowments for the professorial chairs.
To the several faculties also belong various collegiate buildings,
notably, to the legal, that of the <i>Collegium beatae Virginis</i> in
the Petersstrasse, and to the philosophical the <i>Rothe Haus</i>
on the promenade facing the theatre. The other educational
institutions of Leipzig include the Nicolai and Thomas gymnasia,
several &ldquo;Realschulen,&rdquo; a commercial academy (<i>Handelsschule</i>),
high schools for girls, and a large number of public and private
schools of all grades.</p>

<p><i>Art and Literature.</i>&mdash;The city has a large number of literary,
scientific and artistic institutions. One of the most important
is the museum, which contains about four hundred modern
paintings, a large number of casts, a few pieces of original sculpture
and a well-arranged collection of drawings and engravings.
The collection of the historical society and the ethnographical
and art-industrial collections in the Grassi Museum are also of
considerable interest. The museum was erected with part of
the munificent bequest made to the city by Dominic Grassi in
1881. As a musical centre Leipzig is known all over the world
for its excellent conservatorium, founded in 1843 by Mendelssohn.
The series of concerts given annually in the Gewandhaus is
also of world-wide reputation, and the operatic stage of Leipzig
is deservedly ranked among the finest in Germany. There
are numerous vocal and orchestral societies, some of which have
brought their art to a very high pitch of perfection. The prominence
of the publishing interest has attracted to Leipzig a large
number of gifted authors, and made it a literary centre of considerable
importance. Over five hundred newspapers and
periodicals are published here, including several of the most
widely circulated in Germany. Intellectual interests of a high
order have always characterized Leipzig, and what Karl von
Holtei once said of it is true to-day: &ldquo;There is only one city
in Germany that represents Germany; only a single city where
one can forget that he is a Hessian, a Bavarian, a Swabian, a
Prussian or a Saxon; only one city where, amid the opulence
of the commercial world with which science is so gloriously allied,
even the man who possesses nothing but his personality is
honoured and esteemed; only one city, in which, despite a
few narrownesses, all the advantages of a great, I may say a
world-metropolis, are conspicuous! This city is, in my opinion,
and in my experience, Leipzig.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Commerce, Fairs.</i>&mdash;The outstanding importance of Leipzig
as a commercial town is mainly derived from its three great
fairs, which annually attract an enormous concourse of merchants
from all parts of Europe, and from Persia, Armenia and other
Asiatic countries. The most important fairs are held at Easter
and Michaelmas, and are said to have been founded as markets
about 1170. The smaller New Year&rsquo;s fair was established in
1458. Under the fostering care of the margraves of Meissen,
and then of the electors of Saxony they attained great popularity.
In 1268 the margrave of Meissen granted a safe-conduct to all
frequenters of the fairs, and in 1497 and 1507 the emperor
Maximilian I. greatly increased their importance by prohibiting
the holding of annual markets at any town within a wide radius of
Leipzig. During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, the Seven Years&rsquo; War
and the troubles consequent upon the French Revolution, the
trade of the Leipzig fairs considerably decreased, but it recovered
after the accession of Saxony to the German Customs
Union (<i>Zollverein</i>) in 1834, and for the next twenty years rapidly
and steadily increased. Since then, owing to the greater facilities
of communication, the transactions at the fairs have diminished
in relative, though they have increased in actual, value. Wares
that can be safely purchased by sample appear at the fairs in
steadily diminishing quantities, while others, such as hides,
furs and leather, which require to be actually examined, show
as marked an increase. The value of the sales considerably
exceeds £10,000,000 sterling per annum. The principal commodity
is furs (chiefly American and Russian), of which about
one and a quarter million pounds worth are sold annually;
other articles disposed of are leather, hides, wool, cloth, linen
and glass. The Leipzig wool-market, held for two days in June,
is also important.</p>

<p>In the trades of bookselling and publishing Leipzig occupies
a unique position, not only taking the first place in Germany,
but even surpassing London and Paris in the number and total
value of its sales. There are upwards of nine hundred publishers
and booksellers in the town, and about eleven thousand
firms in other parts of Europe are represented here. Several
hundred booksellers assemble in Leipzig every year, and settle
their accounts at their own exchange (<i>Buchhändler-Börse</i>).
Leipzig also contains about two hundred printing-works, some
of great extent, and a corresponding number of type-foundries,
binding-shops and other kindred industries.</p>

<p>The book trades give employment to over 15,000 persons,
and since 1878 Leipzig has grown into an industrial town of the
first rank. The iron and machinery trades employ 4500 persons;
the textile industries, cotton and yarn spinning and hosiery,
6000; and the making of scientific and musical instruments,
including pianos, 2650. Other industries include the manufacture
of artificial flowers, wax-cloth, chemicals, ethereal oils and
essences, beer, mineral waters, tobacco and cigars, lace, india-rubber
wares, rush-work and paper, the preparation of furs
and numerous other branches. These industries are mostly
carried on in the suburbs of Plagwitz, Reudnitz, Lindenau,
Gohlis, Eutritzsch, Konnewitz and the neighbouring town of
Markranstädt.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Leipzig lies at the centre of a network
of railways giving it direct communication with all the more
important cities of Germany. There are six main line railway
stations, of which the Dresden and the Magdeburg lie side
by side in the north-east corner of the promenade, the Thuringian
and Berlin stations further away in the northern suburb;
in the eastern is the Eilenburg station (for Breslau and the east)
and in the south the Bavarian station. The whole traffic of
these stations is to be directed into a vast central station (the
largest in the world), lying on the sites of the Dresden, Magdeburg
and Thuringian stations. The estimated cost, borne by
Prussia, Saxony and the city of Leipzig, is estimated at 6 million
pounds sterling. The city has an extensive electric tramway
system, bringing all the outlying suburbs into close connexion
with the business quarters of the town.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population of Leipzig was quintupled within
the 19th century, rising from 31,887 in 1801 to 153,988 in 1881,
to 455,089 in 1900 and to 502,570 in 1905.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Leipzig owes its origin to a Slav settlement between
the Elster and the Pleisse, which was in existence before the year
1000, and its name to the Slav word <i>lipa</i>, a lime tree. There was
also a German settlement near this spot, probably round a castle
erected early in the 10th century by the German king, Henry the
Fowler. The district was part of the mark of Merseburg, and the
bishops of Merseburg were the lords of extensive areas around the
settlements. In the 11th century Leipzig is mentioned as a fortified
place and in the 12th it came into the possession of the margrave
of Meissen, being granted some municipal privileges by the margrave,
Otto the Rich, before 1190. Its favourable situation in the
midst of a plain intersected by the principal highways of central
Europe, together with the fostering care of its rulers, now began
the work of raising Leipzig to the position of a very important
commercial town. Its earliest trade was in the salt produced at
Halle, and its enterprising inhabitants constructed roads and bridges
to lighten the journey of the traders and travellers whose way led
to the town. Soon Leipzig was largely used as a depot by the
merchants of Nuremberg, who carried on a considerable trade with
Poland. Powers of self-government were acquired by the council
(<i>Rat</i>) of the town, the importance of which was enhanced during
the 15th century by several grants of privileges from the emperors.
When Saxony was divided in 1485 Leipzig fell to the Albertine, or
ducal branch of the family, whose head Duke George gave new
rights to the burghers. This duke, however, at whose instigation
the famous discussion between Luther and Johann von Eck took
place in the Pleissenburg of Leipzig, inflicted some injury upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
town&rsquo;s trade and also upon its university by the harsh treatment
which he meted out to the adherents of the new doctrines; but
under the rule of his successor, Henry, Leipzig accepted the teaching
of the reformers. In 1547 during the war of the league of Schmalkalden
the town was besieged by the elector of Saxony, John
Frederick I. It was not captured, although its suburbs were destroyed.
These and the Pleissenburg were rebuilt by the elector
Maurice, who also strengthened the fortifications. Under the elector
Augustus I. emigrants from the Netherlands were encouraged to
settle in Leipzig and its trade with Hamburg and with England
was greatly extended.</p>

<p>During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War Leipzig suffered six sieges and on
four occasions was occupied by hostile troops, being retained by
the Swedes as security for the payment of an indemnity from
1648 to 1650. After 1650 its fortifications were strengthened; its
finances were put on a better footing; and its trade, especially with
England, began again to prosper; important steps being taken
with regard to its organization. Towards the end of the 17th century
the publishing trade began to increase very rapidly, partly because
the severity of the censorship at Frankfort-on-the-Main caused
many booksellers to remove to Leipzig. During the Seven Years&rsquo;
War Frederick the Great exacted a heavy contribution from Leipzig,
but this did not seriously interfere with its prosperity. In 1784
the fortifications were pulled down. The wars in the first decade
of the 19th century were not on the whole unfavourable to the
commerce of Leipzig, but in 1813 and 1814, owing to the presence
of enormous armies in the neighbourhood, it suffered greatly.
Another revival, however, set in after the peace of 1815, and this
was aided by the accession of Saxony to the German Zollverein in
1834, and by the opening of the first railway a little later. In 1831
the town was provided with a new constitution, and in 1837 a scheme
for the reform of the university was completed. A riot in 1845,
the revolutionary movement of 1848 and the Prussian occupation
of 1866 were merely passing shadows. In 1879 Leipzig acquired a
new importance by becoming the seat of the supreme court of the
German empire.</p>

<p>The immediate neighbourhood of Leipzig has been the scene of
several battles, two of which are of more than ordinary importance.
These are the battles of Breitenfeld, fought on the 17th of September
1631, between the Swedes under Gustavus Adolphus and the imperialists,
and the great battle of Leipzig, known in Germany as the
Völkerschlacht, fought in October 1813 between Napoleon and the
allied forces of Russia, Prussia and Austria.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the 18th century Leipzig was the seat of
the most influential body of literary men in Germany, over whom
Johann Christoph Gottsched, like his contemporary, Samuel Johnson,
in England, exercised a kind of literary dictatorship. Then, if ever,
Leipzig deserved the epithet of a &ldquo;Paris in miniature&rdquo; (<i>Klein Paris</i>)
assigned to it by Goethe in his <i>Faust</i>. The young Lessing produced
his first play in the Leipzig theatre, and the university counts
Goethe, Klopstock, Jean Paul Richter, Fichte and Schelling among
its alumni. Schiller and Gellert also resided for a time in Leipzig,
and Sebastian Bach and Mendelssohn filled musical posts here.
Among the celebrated natives of the town are the philosopher
Leibnitz and the composer Wagner.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIRIA,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> an episcopal city and the capital of the district of
Leiria, formerly included in Estremadura, Portugal; on the
river Liz and on the Lisbon-Figueria da Foz railway. Pop.
(1900) 4459. The principal buildings of Leiria are the ruined
citadel, which dates from 1135, and the cathedral, a small
Renaissance building erected in 1571 but modernized in the
18th century. The main square of the city is named after the
poet Francisco Rodrigues Lobo, who was born here about 1500.
Between Leiria and the Atlantic there are extensive pine woods
known as the Pinhal de Leiria, which were planted by King
Diniz (1279-1325) with trees imported from the Landes in
France, in order to give firmness to the sandy soil. In the
neighbourhood there are glass and iron foundries, oil wells and
mineral springs. Leiria, the Roman Calippo, was taken from
the Moors in 1135 by Alphonso I. (Affonso Henriques). King
Diniz made it his capital. In 1466 the first Portuguese printing-press
was established here; in 1545 the city was made an
episcopal see. The administrative district of Leiria coincides
with the north and north-west of the ancient province of
Estremadura (<i>q.v.</i>); pop. (1900) 238,755; area 1317 sq. m.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEISLER, JACOB<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1635-1691), American political agitator,
was born probably at Frankfort-on-Main, Germany, about 1635.
He went to New Netherland (New York) in 1660, married a
wealthy widow, engaged in trade, and soon accumulated a
fortune. The English Revolution of 1688 divided the people
of New York into two well-defined factions. In general the small
shop-keepers, small farmers, sailors, poor traders and artisans
were arrayed against the patroons, rich fur-traders, merchants,
lawyers and crown officers. The former were led by Leisler, the
latter by Peter Schuyler (1657-1724), Nicholas Bayard (<i>c.</i> 1644-1707),
Stephen van Cortlandt (1643-1700), William Nicolls (1657-1723)
and other representatives of the aristocratic Hudson Valley
families. The &ldquo;Leislerians&rdquo; pretended greater loyalty to the
Protestant succession. When news of the imprisonment of Gov.
Andros in Massachusetts was received, they took possession on
the 31st of May 1689 of Fort James (at the southern end of
Manhattan Island), renamed it Fort William and announced their
determination to hold it until the arrival of a governor commissioned
by the new sovereigns. The aristocrats also favoured the
Revolution, but preferred to continue the government under
authority from James II. rather than risk the danger of an interregnum.
Lieutenant-Governor Francis Nicholson sailed for England
on the 24th of June, a committee of safety was organized by
the popular party, and Leisler was appointed commander-in-chief.
Under authority of a letter from the home government addressed
to Nicholson, &ldquo;or in his absence, to such as for the time being
takes care for preserving the peace and administering the laws
in His Majesty&rsquo;s province of New York,&rdquo; he assumed the title
of lieutenant-governor in December 1689, appointed a council
and took charge of the government of the entire province. He
summoned the first Intercolonial Congress in America, which met
in New York on the 1st of May 1690 to plan concerted action
against the French and Indians. Colonel Henry Sloughter was
commissioned governor of the province on the 2nd of September
1689 but did not reach New York until the 19th of March 1691.
In the meantime Major Richard Ingoldsby and two companies of
soldiers had landed (January 28, 1691) and demanded possession
of the fort. Leisler refused to surrender it, and after some controversy
an attack was made on the 17th of March in which
two soldiers were killed and several wounded. When Sloughter
arrived two days later Leisler hastened to give over to him the
fort and other evidences of authority. He and his son-in-law,
Jacob Milborne, were charged with treason for refusing to submit
to Ingoldsby, were convicted, and on the 16th of May 1691
were executed. There has been much controversy among
historians with regard both to the facts and to the significance
of Leisler&rsquo;s brief career as ruler in New York.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEISNIG,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> a town in the kingdom of Saxony, prettily situated
on the Freiberger Mulde, 7 m. S. of Grimma by the railway
from Leipzig to Dresden via Döbeln. Pop. (1905) 8147. On a
high rock above the town lies the old castle of Mildenstein,
now utilized as administrative offices. The industries include
the manufacture of cloth, furniture, boots, buttons, cigars,
beer, machinery and chemicals. Leisnig is a place of considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
antiquity. About 1080 it passed into the possession of the
counts of Groitzsch, but was purchased in 1157 by the emperor
Frederick I., who committed it to the charge of counts. It fell
to Meissen in 1365, and later to Saxony.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEITH,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> a municipal and police burgh, and seaport, county of
Midlothian, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 77,439. It is situated
on the south shore of the Firth of Forth, 1½ m. N.N.E. of
Edinburgh, of which it is the port and with which it is connected
by Leith Walk, practically a continuous street. It has stations
on the North British and Caledonian railways, and a branch
line (N.B.R.) to Portobello. Lying at the mouth of the Water
of Leith, which is crossed by several bridges and divides it into
the parishes of North and South Leith, it stretches for 3¼ m.
along the shore of the Firth from Seafield in the east to near
Granton in the west. There is tramway communication with
Edinburgh and Newhaven.</p>

<p>The town is a thriving centre of trade and commerce. St
Mary&rsquo;s in Kirkgate, the parish church of South Leith, was
founded in 1483, and was originally cruciform but, as restored
in 1852, consists of an aisled nave and north-western tower.
Here David Lindsay (1531-1613), its minister, James VI.&rsquo;s
chaplain and afterwards bishop of Ross, preached before the
king the thanksgiving sermon on the Gowrie conspiracy (1600).
John Logan, the hymn-writer and reputed author of &ldquo;The Ode
to the Cuckoo,&rdquo; was minister for thirteen years; and in its
graveyard lies the Rev. John Home, author of <i>Douglas</i>, a native
of Leith. Near it in Constitution Street is St James&rsquo;s Episcopal
church (1862-1869), in the Early English style by Sir Gilbert
Scott, with an apsidal chancel and a spire 160 ft. high. The
parish church of North Leith, in Madeira Street, with a spire
158 ft. high, is one of the best livings in the Established Church
of Scotland. St Thomas&rsquo;s, at the head of Shirra Brae, in the
Gothic style, was built in 1843 by Sir John Gladstone of Fasque,
who&mdash;prior to his removal to Liverpool, where his son, W. E.
Gladstone, was born&mdash;had been a merchant in Leith. The public
buildings are wholly modern, the principal being of classic
design. They include the custom house (1812) in the Grecian
style; Trinity House (1817), also Grecian, containing Sir Henry
Raeburn&rsquo;s portrait of Admiral Lord Duncan, David Scott&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Vasco da Gama Rounding the Cape&rdquo; and other paintings;
the markets (1818); the town hall (1828), with an Ionic façade
on Constitution Street and a Doric porch on Charlotte Street;
the corn exchange (1862) in the Roman style; the assembly
rooms; exchange buildings; the public institute (1867) and
Victoria public baths (1899). Trinity House was founded in 1555
as a home for old and disabled sailors, but on the decline of its
revenues it became the licensing authority for pilots, its humane
office being partly fulfilled by the sailors&rsquo; home, established
about 1840 in a building adjoining the Signal Tower, and rehoused
in a handsome structure in the Scottish Baronial style
in 1883-1884. Other charitable institutions include the hospital,
John Watt&rsquo;s hospital and the smallpox hospital. The high
school, built in 1806, for many years a familiar object on the
west margin of the Links, gave way to the academy, a handsome
and commodious structure, to which are drafted senior
pupils from the numerous board schools for free education in
the higher branches. Here also is accommodated the technical
college. Secondary instruction is given also in Craighall Road
school. A bronze statue of Robert Burns was unveiled in 1898.
Leith Links, one of the homes of golf in Scotland, is a popular
resort, on Lochend Road are situated Hawkhill recreation
grounds, and Lochend Loch is used for skating and curling.
There are small links at Newhaven, and in Trinity are Starbank
Park and Cargilfield playing ground. The east pier (1177 yds.
long) and the west pier (1041 yds.) are favourite promenades.
The waterway between them is the entrance to the harbour.
Leith cemetery is situated at Seafield and the Eastern cemetery
in Easter Road.</p>

<p>The oldest industry is shipbuilding, which dates from 1313.
Here in 1511 James IV. built the &ldquo;St Michael,&rdquo; &ldquo;ane verrie
monstruous great ship, whilk tuik sae meikle timber that schee
waisted all the woodis in Fyfe, except Falkland wood, besides
the timber that cam out of Norroway.&rdquo; Other important
industries are engineering, sugar-refining (established 1757),
meat-preserving, flour-milling, sailcloth-making, soap-boiling,
rope and twine-making, tanning, chemical manures-making,
wood-sawing, hosiery, biscuit-baking, brewing, distilling and
lime-juice making. Of the old trade of glass-making, which
began in 1682, scarcely a trace survives. As a distributing
centre, Leith occupies a prominent place. It is the headquarters
of the whisky business in Great Britain, and stores also large
quantities of wine from Spain, Portugal and France. This
pre-eminence is due to its excellent dock and harbour accommodation
and capacious warehouses. The two old docks
(1801-1807) cover 10½ acres; Victoria Dock (1852) 5 acres;
Albert Dock (1863-1869) 10¾ acres; Edinburgh Dock (1874-1881)
16<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> acres; and the New Dock (1892-1901) 60 acres.
There are several dry docks, of which the Prince of Wales Graving
Dock (1858), the largest, measures 370 ft. by 60 ft. Space can
always be had for more dock room by reclaiming the east sands,
where in the 17th and 18th centuries Leith Races were held,
the theme of a humorous descriptive poem by Robert Fergusson.
Apart from coasting trade there are constant sailings to the
leading European ports, the United States and the British
colonies. In 1908 the tonnage of ships entering the harbour
was (including coastwise trade) 1,975,457; that of ships clearing
the harbour 1,993,227. The number of vessels registered at the
port was 213 (net tonnage 146,799). The value of imports
was £12,883,890, of exports £5,377,188. In summer there are
frequent excursions to the Bass Rock and the Isle of May,
North Berwick, Elie, Aberdour, Alloa and Stirling. Leith Fort,
built in North Leith in 1779 for the defence of the harbour, is
now the headquarters of the Royal Artillery in Scotland. Leith
is the head of a fishery district. The town, which is governed by
a provost, bailies and council, unites with Musselburgh and
Portobello to send one member to parliament.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leith figures as Inverleith in the foundation charter of Holyrood
Abbey (1128). In 1329 Robert I. granted the harbour to the
magistrates of Edinburgh, who did not always use their power
wisely. They forbade, for example, the building of streets wide
enough to admit a cart, a regulation that accounted for the number
of narrow wynds and alleys in the town. Had the overlords been
more considerate incorporation with Edinburgh would not have
been so bitterly resisted. Several of the quaint bits of ancient
Leith yet remain, and the appearance of the shore as it was in the
17th and 18th centuries, and even at a later date, was picturesque
in the extreme. During the centuries of strife between Scotland
and England its situation exposed the port to attack both by sea
and land. At least twice (in 1313 and 1410) its shipping was burned
by the English, who also sacked the town in 1544&mdash;when the 1st
earl of Hertford destroyed the first wooden pier&mdash;and 1547. In
the troublous times that followed the death of James V., Leith
became the stronghold of the Roman Catholic and French party
from 1548 to 1560, Mary of Guise, queen regent, not deeming herself
secure in Edinburgh. In 1549 the town was walled and fortified by
Montalembert, sicur d&rsquo;Essé, the commander of the French troops,
and endured an ineffectual siege in 1560 by the Scots and their
English allies. A house in Coalhill is thought to be the &ldquo;handsome
and spacious edifice&rdquo; erected for her privy council by Mary of
Guise. D&rsquo;Essé&rsquo;s wall, pierced by six gates, was partly dismantled
on the death of the queen regent, but although rebuilt in 1571, not
a trace of it exists. The old tolbooth, in which William Maitland of
Lethington, Queen Mary&rsquo;s secretary, poisoned himself in 1573,
to avoid execution for adhering to Mary&rsquo;s cause, was demolished in
1819. Charles I. is said to have received the first tidings of the
Irish rebellion while playing golf on the links in 1641. Cromwell
in his Scottish campaign built the Citadel in 1650 and the mounds
on the links, known as &ldquo;Giant&rsquo;s Brae&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lady Fife&rsquo;s Brae,&rdquo;
were thrown up by the Protector as batteries. In 1698 the sailing
of the first Darien expedition created great excitement. In 1715
William Mackintosh of Borlum (1662-1743) and his force of Jacobite
Highlanders captured the Citadel, of which only the name of Citadel
Street and the archway in Couper Street have preserved the memory.</p>

<p>A mile S.E. of the links lies the ancient village of <span class="sc">Restalrig</span>,
the home of the Logans, from whom the superiority of Leith was
purchased in 1553 by the queen regent. Sir Robert Logan (d. 1606)
was alleged to have been one of the Gowrie conspirators and to have
arranged to imprison the king in Fast Castle. This charge, however,
was not made until three years after his death, when his
bones were exhumed for trial. He was then found guilty of high
treason and sentence of forfeiture pronounced; but there is reason
to suspect that the whole case was trumped up. The old church
escaped demolition at the Reformation and even the fine east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>
window was saved. In the vaults repose Sir Robert and other
Logans, besides several of the lords Balmerino, and Lord Brougham&rsquo;s
father lies in the kirkyard. The well of St Triduana, which was
reputed to possess wonderful curative powers, vanished when the
North British railway was constructed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEITMERITZ<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> (Czech, <i>Litom&#283;&#345;ice</i>), a town and episcopal see of
Bohemia, 45 m. N. of Prague by rail. Pop. (1900) 13,075, mostly
German. It lies on the right bank of the Elbe, which becomes
here navigable for steamers and is spanned by an iron bridge
1700 ft. in length. The fine cathedral, founded in 1057, was
built in 1671 and contains some valuable paintings. The library
of the episcopal palace, built between 1694 and 1701, possesses the
oldest maps of Bohemia made in 1518 by Nicolaus Claudianus
of Jung-Bunzlau. Of the other churches that of All Saints dates
from the 13th century. The town-hall, with its remarkable
bell tower, dates from the 15th century. Leitmeritz is situated in
the midst of a very fertile country, called the &ldquo;Bohemian
Paradise,&rdquo; which produces great quantities of corn, fruit, hops
and wines. The beer brewed here enjoys a high reputation.
On the opposite bank of the river, where the Eger discharges
itself into the Elbe, lies Theresienstadt (pop. 7046), an important
garrison town. It was formerly an important fortress, erected
in 1780 by the emperor Joseph II. and named after his mother
Maria Theresa, but the fortress was dismantled in 1882.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leitmeritz was originally the castle of a royal count and is first
mentioned, in 993, in the foundation charter of the convent of St
Margaret near Prague. In 1248 it received a town charter, and was
governed by the laws of Magdeburg until the time of Ferdinand I.,
having a special court of jurisdiction over all the royal towns where
this law obtained. The town reached its highest degree of prosperity
under Charles IV., who bestowed upon it large tracts of forest,
agricultural land and vineyards. In the Hussite wars, after its
capture by the utraquist, Leitmeritz remained true to &ldquo;the Chalice,&rdquo;
shared also in the revolt against Ferdinand I., and suffered in consequence.
It was still more unfortunate during the Thirty Years&rsquo;
War, in the course of which most of the Protestant inhabitants left
it; the property of the Bohemian refugees being given to German
immigrants. The present bishopric was established in 1655.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEITNER, GOTTLIEB WILHELM<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (1840-1899), Anglo-Hungarian
orientalist, was born at Budapest in 1840. He was the son
of a physician, and was educated at Malta Protestant college.
At the age of fifteen he acted as an interpreter in the Crimean
War. He entered King&rsquo;s College, London, in 1858, and in
1861 was appointed professor of Arabic and Mahommedan law.
He became principal of the government college at Lahore in
1864, and there originated the term &ldquo;Dardistan&rdquo; for a portion
of the mountains on the north-west frontier, which was subsequently
recognized to be a purely artificial distinction. He
collected much valuable information on Graeco-Buddhist art
and the origins of Indian art. He spoke, read and wrote twenty-five
languages. He founded an oriental institute at Woking,
and for some years edited the <i>Asiatic Quarterly Review</i>. He died
at Bonn in 1899.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEITRIM,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> a county of Ireland in the province of Connaught,
bounded N.W. by Donegal Bay, N.E. by Fermanagh, E. by
Cavan, S.E. by Longford, S.W. by Roscommon and W. by
Sligo. The area is 392,381 acres, or about 613 sq. m. The
northern portion of the county consists of an elevated tableland,
of which the highest summits belong to the Truskmore Hills,
reaching 1712 ft.; with Benbo, 1365 ft. and Lackagh, 1446 ft.
In the southern part the country is comparatively level, and
is generally richly wooded. The county touches the south coast
of Donegal Bay, but the coast-line is only about 3 m. The
principal river is the Shannon, which, issuing from Lough Allen,
forms the south-western boundary of the county with Roscommon.
The Bonnet rises in the north-west and flows to Lough
Gill, and the streams of Drones and Duff separate Leitrim from
Donegal and Sligo. Besides Lough Allen, which has an area of
8900 acres, the other principal lakes in the county are Lough
Macnean, Lough Scur, Lough Garadice and Lough Melvin.
The scenery of the north is wild and attractive, while in the
neighbourhood of the Shannon it is of great beauty. Lough
Melvin and the coast rivers afford rod fishing, the lough being
noted for its gillaroo trout.</p>

<p>This varied county has in general a floor of Carboniferous
Limestone, which forms finely scarped hills as it reaches the
sea in Donegal Bay. The underlying sandstone appears at Lough
Melvin, and again on the margin of a Silurian area in the extreme
south. The Upper Carboniferous series, dipping gently southward,
form mountainous country round Lough Allen, where the
name of Slieve Anierin records the abundance of clay-ironstone
beneath the coal seams. The sandstones and shales of this series
scarp boldly towards the valley of the Bonnet, across which rises,
in picturesque contrast, the heather-clad ridge of ancient gneiss
which forms, in Benbo, the north-east end of the Ox Mountains.
The ironstone was smelted in the upland at Creevelea down
to 1859, and the coal is worked in a few thin seams.</p>

<p>The climate is moist and unsuitable for grain crops. On the
higher districts the soil is stiff and cold, and, though abounding
in stones, retentive of moisture, but in the valleys there are
some fertile districts. Lime, marl and similar manures are
abundant, and on the coast seaweed is plentiful. The proportion
of tillage to pasture is roughly as 1 to 3. Potatoes are grown,
but oats, the principal grain crop, are scanty. The live stock
consists chiefly of cattle, pigs and poultry. Coarse linens for
domestic purposes are manufactured and coarse pottery is also
made. The Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties railway,
connecting Sligo with Enniskillen, crosses the northern part of
the county, by way of Manor Hamilton; the Mullingar and
Sligo line of the Midland Great Western touches the south-western
boundary of the county, with a station at Carrick-on-Shannon;
while connecting with this line at Dromod is the
Cavan and Leitrim railway to Ballinamore and Arigna, and to
Belturbet in county Cavan.</p>

<p>The population (78,618 in 1891; 69,343 in 1901) decreases
owing to emigration, the decrease being one of the most serious
shown by any Irish county. It includes nearly 90% of Roman
Catholics. The only towns are Carrick-on-Shannon (pop. 1118)
and Manor Hamilton (993). The county is divided into five
baronies. It is within the Connaught circuit, and assizes are held
at Carrick-on-Shannon, and quarter sessions at Ballinamore,
Carrick-on-Shannon and Manor Hamilton. It is in the Protestant
diocese of Kilmore, and the Roman Catholic dioceses of Ardagh
and Kilmore. In the Irish House of Commons two members
were returned for the county and two for the boroughs of Carrick-on-Shannon
and Jamestown, but at the Union the boroughs were
disfranchised. The county divisions are termed the North and
South, each returning one member.</p>

<p>With the territory which afterwards became the county Cavan,
Leitrim formed part of Brenny or Breffny, which was divided
into two principalities, of which Leitrim, under the name of
Hy Bruin-Brenny, formed the western. Being for a long time
in the possession of the O&rsquo;Rourkes, descendants of Roderick,
king of Ireland, it was also called Brenny O&rsquo;Rourke. This
family long maintained its independence; even in 1579, when
the other existing counties of Connaught were created, the
creation of Leitrim was deferred, and did not take place until
1583. Large confiscations were made in the reigns of Elizabeth
and James I., in the Cromwellian period, and after the Revolution
of 1688.</p>

<p>There are &ldquo;druidical&rdquo; remains near Fenagh and at Letterfyan,
and important monastic ruins at Creevelea near the
Bonnet, with several antique monuments, and in the parish of
Fenagh. There was a flourishing Franciscan friary at Jamestown.
The abbeys of Mohill, Annaduff and Drumlease are
converted into parish churches. Among the more notable old
castles are Manor Hamilton Castle, originally very extensive,
but now in ruins, and Castle John on an island in Lough Scur.
There is a small village named Leitrim about 4 m. N. of Carrick-on-Shannon,
which was once of enough importance to give its
name to a barony and to the county, and is said to have been
the seat of an early bishopric.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEIXÕES,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> a seaport and harbour of refuge of northern
Portugal; in 41° 9&prime; 10&Prime; N., 8° 40&prime; 35&Prime; W., 3 m. N. of the mouth
of the Douro. Leixões is included in the parish of Matozinhos
(pop. 1900, 7690) and constitutes the main port of the city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
Oporto (<i>q.v.</i>), with which it is connected by an electric tramway.
The harbour, of artificial construction, has an area of over 220
acres, and admits vessels of any size, the depth at the entrance
being nearly 50 ft. The transference of cargo to and from ships
lying in the Leixões basin is effected entirely by means of lighters
from Oporto. In addition to wine, &amp;c., from Oporto, large
numbers of emigrants to South America are taken on board here.
The trade of the port is mainly in British hands, and large
numbers of British ships call at Leixões on the voyage between
Lisbon and Liverpool, London or Southampton.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEJEUNE, LOUIS FRANÇOIS,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1776-1848), French
general, painter, and lithographer, was born at Versailles. As
aide-de-camp to General Berthier he took an active part in many
of the Napoleonic campaigns, which he made the subjects of an
important series of battle-pictures. The vogue he enjoyed is
due to the truth and vigour of his work, which was generally
executed from sketches and studies made on the battlefield.
When his battle-pictures were shown at the Egyptian Hall in
London, a rail had to be put up to protect them from the eager
crowds of sightseers. Among his chief works are &ldquo;The Entry
of Charles X. into Paris, 6 June 1825&rdquo; at Versailles; &ldquo;Episode
of the Prussian War, October 1807&rdquo; at Douai Museum;
&ldquo;Marengo&rdquo; (1801); &ldquo;Lodi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thabor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aboukir&rdquo; (1804); &ldquo;The
Pyramids&rdquo; (1806); &ldquo;Passage of the Rhine in 1795&rdquo; (1824), and
&ldquo;Moskawa&rdquo; (1812). The German campaign of 1806 brought
him to Munich, where he visited the workshop of Senefelder,
the inventor of lithography. Lejeune was so fascinated by the
possibilities of the new method that he then and there made the
drawing on stone of his famous &ldquo;Cossack&rdquo; (printed by C. and
T. Senefelder, 1806). Whilst he was taking his dinner, and with
his horses harnessed and waiting to take him back to Paris,
one hundred proofs were printed, one of which he subsequently
submitted to Napoleon. The introduction of lithography
into France was greatly due to the efforts of Lejeune.
Many of his battle-pictures were engraved by Coiny and
Bovinet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEKAIN,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> the stage name of Henri Louis Cain (1728-1778),
French actor, who was born in Paris on the 14th of April 1728,
the son of a silversmith. He was educated at the Collège Mazarin,
and joined an amateur company of players against which the
Comédie Française obtained an injunction. Voltaire supported
him for a time and enabled him to act in his private theatre
and also before the duchess of Maine. Owing to the hostility
of the actors it was only after a struggle of seventeen months
that, by the command of Louis XV., he was received at the
Comédie Française. His success was immediate. Among his
best parts were Herod in <i>Mariamne</i>, Nero in <i>Britannicus</i> and
similar tragic rôles, in spite of the fact that he was short and
stout, with irregular and rather common features. His name is
connected with a number of important scenic reforms. It was
he who had the benches removed on which privileged spectators
formerly sat encumbering the stage, Count Lauragais paying
for him an excessive indemnity demanded. Lekain also protested
against the method of sing-song declamation prevalent, and
endeavoured to correct the costuming of the plays, although
unable to obtain the historic accuracy at which Talma aimed.
He died in Paris on the 8th of February 1778.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His eldest son published his <i>Mémoires</i> (1801) with his correspondence
with Voltaire, Garrick and others. They were reprinted with

<p><span class="bold">LELAND, CHARLES GODFREY<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (1824-1903), American
author, son of a merchant, was born at Philadelphia on the 15th
of August 1824, and graduated at Princeton in 1845. He afterwards
studied at Heidelberg, Munich and Paris. He was in
Paris during the revolution of 1848, and took an active part in it.
He then returned to Philadelphia, and after being admitted to
the bar in 1851, devoted himself to contributing to periodicals,
editing various magazines and writing books. At the opening of
the Civil War he started at Boston the <i>Continental Magazine</i>,
which advocated emancipation. In 1868 he became known as
the humorous author of <i>Hans Breitmann&rsquo;s Party and Ballads</i>,
which was followed by other volumes of the same kind, collected
in 1871 with the title of <i>Hans Breitmann&rsquo;s Ballads</i>. These dialect
poems, burlesquing the German American, at once became
popular. In 1869 he went to Europe, and till 1880 was occupied,
chiefly in London, with literary work; after returning to Philadelphia
for six years, he again made his home in Europe,
generally at Florence, where he died on the 20th of March 1903.
Though his humorous verses were most attractive to the public,
Leland was a serious student of folk-lore, particularly of the
gipsies, his writings on the latter (<i>The English Gypsies and their
Language</i>, 1872; <i>The Gypsies</i>, 1882; <i>Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune-telling</i> ..., 1891,
&amp;c.) being recognized as valuable contributions

<p><span class="bold">LELAND<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Leyland</span> or <span class="sc">Laylonde</span>), <span class="bold">JOHN</span> (<i>c.</i> 1506-1552),
English antiquary, was born in London on the 13th of September,
probably in 1506. He owed his education at St Paul&rsquo;s school
under William Lilly, and at Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, to the
kindness of a patron, Thomas Myles. He graduated at Cambridge
in 1521, and subsequently studied at All Souls College, Oxford,
and in Paris under François Dubois (Sylvius). On his return to
England he took holy orders. He had been tutor to Lord Thomas
Howard, son of the 3rd duke of Norfolk, and to Francis Hastings,
afterwards earl of Huntingdon. Meanwhile his learning had
recommended him to Henry VIII., who presented him to the
rectory of Peuplingues in the marches of Calais in 1530. He
was already librarian and chaplain to the king, and in 1533 he
received a novel commission under the great seal as king&rsquo;s
antiquary, with power to search for records, manuscripts and
relics of antiquity in all the cathedrals, colleges and religious
houses of England. Probably from 1534, and definitely from
1536 onwards to 1542, he was engaged on an antiquarian tour
through England and Wales. He sought to preserve the MSS.
scattered at the dissolution of the monasteries, but his powers did
not extend to the actual collection of MSS. Some valuable
additions, however, he did procure for the king&rsquo;s library, chiefly
from the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury. He had received
a special dispensation permitting him to absent himself from his
rectory of Peuplingues in 1536, and on his return from his
itinerary he received the rectory of Haseley in Oxfordshire;
his support of the church policy of Henry and Cranmer being
further rewarded by a canonry and prebend of King&rsquo;s College
(now Christ Church), Oxford, and a prebend of Salisbury. In
a <i>Strena Henrico</i><a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (pr. 1546), addressed to Henry VIII. in
1545, he proposed to execute from the materials which he had
collected in his journeys a topography of England, an account
of the adjacent islands, an account of the British nobility, and a
great history of the antiquities of the British Isles. He toiled
over his papers at his house in the parish of St Michael le Querne,
Cheapside, London, but he was not destined to complete these
great undertakings, for he was certified insane in March 1550,
and died on the 18th of April 1552.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leland was an exact observer, and a diligent student of local
chronicles. The bulk of his work remained in MS. at the time of
his death, and various copies were made, one by John Stowe in
1576. After passing through various hands the greater part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>
Leland&rsquo;s MSS. were deposited by William Burton, the historian of
Leicestershire, in the Bodleian at Oxford. They had in the meantime
been freely used by other antiquaries, notably by John Bale,
William Camden and Sir William Dugdale. The account of his
journey in England and Wales in eight MS. quarto volumes received
its name <i>The Itinerary of John Leland</i> from Thomas Burton and
was edited by Thomas Hearne (9 vols., Oxford, 1710-1712; other
editions in 1745 and 1770). The scattered portions dealing with
Wales were re-edited by Miss L. Toulmin Smith in 1907. His other
most important work, the <i>Collectanea</i>, in four folio MS. volumes,
was also published by Hearne (6 vols., Oxford, 1715). His <i>Commentarii
de scriptoribus Britannicis</i>, which had been used and distorted
by his friend John Bale, was edited by Anthony Hall (2 vols.,
Oxford, 1709). Some of Leland&rsquo;s MSS., which formerly belonged to
Sir Robert Cotton, passed into the possession of the British Museum.
He was a Latin poet of some merit, his most famous piece being the
<i>Cygneo Cantio</i> (1545) in honour of Henry VIII. Many of his minor
works are included in Hearne&rsquo;s editions of the <i>Itinerary</i> and the
<i>Collectanea</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LELAND, JOHN<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1691-1766), English Nonconformist divine,
was born at Wigan, Lancashire, and educated in Dublin, where
he made such progress that in 1716, without having attended
any college or hall, he was appointed first assistant and afterwards
sole pastor of a congregation of Presbyterians in New Row.
This office he continued to fill until his death on the 16th of
January 1766. He received the degree of D.D. from Aberdeen
in 1739. His first publication was <i>A Defence of Christianity</i>
(1733), in reply to Matthew Tindal&rsquo;s <i>Christianity as old as the
Creation</i>; it was succeeded by his <i>Divine Authority of the Old and
New Testaments asserted</i> (1738), in answer to <i>The Moral Philosopher</i>
of Thomas Morgan; in 1741 he published two volumes,
in the form of two letters, being <i>Remarks on</i> [H. Dodwell&rsquo;s]
<i>Christianity not founded on Argument</i>; and in 1753 <i>Reflexions
on the late Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s Letters on the Study and Use of
History</i>. His <i>View of the Principal Deistical Writers that have
appeared in England</i> was published in 1754-1756. This is the
chief work of Leland&mdash;&ldquo;most worthy, painstaking and commonplace
of divines,&rdquo; as Sir Leslie Stephen called him&mdash;and in spite
of many defects and inconsistencies is indispensable to every

<p><span class="bold">LELAND STANFORD JR. UNIVERSITY,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> near Palo Alto,
California, U.S.A., in the beautiful Santa Clara valley, was
founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (1824-1893), and by his
wife Jane Lathrop Stanford (1825-1905), as a memorial to their
only child, Leland Stanford, Jr., who died in 1884 in his seventeenth
year. The doors were opened in 1891 to 559 students.
The university campus consists of Stanford&rsquo;s former Palo Alto
farm, which comprises about 9000 acres. From the campus
there are charming views of San Francisco Bay, of the Coast
Range, particularly of Mount Hamilton some 30 m. E. with the
Lick Observatory on its summit, of mountain foothills, and of
the magnificent redwood forests toward Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>The buildings, designed originally by H. H. Richardson
and completed by his successors, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge,
are of soft buff sandstone in a style adapted from the old California
mission (Moorish-Romanesque) architecture, being long
and low with wide colonnades, open arches and red tiled roofs.
An outer surrounds an inner quadrangle of buildings. The
inner quadrangle, about a court which is 586 by 246 ft. and is
faced by a continuous open arcade and adorned with large
circular beds of tropical plants and flowers, consists of twelve
one-storey buildings and a beautiful memorial church. Of the
fourteen buildings of the outer quadrangle some are two storeys
high. A magnificent memorial arch (100 ft. high), adorned with
a frieze designed by John Evans, representing the &ldquo;Progress
of Civilization in America,&rdquo; and forming the main gateway,
was destroyed by the earthquake of 1906. Outside the quadrangles
are other buildings&mdash;a museum of art and archaeology,
based on collections made by Leland Stanford, Jr., chemical
laboratories, engineering work-shops, dormitories, a mausoleum
of the founders, &amp;c. There is a fine arboretum (300 acres) and
a cactus garden. The charming views, the grace and harmonious
colours of the buildings, and the tropic vegetation make a campus
of wonderful beauty. The students in 1907-1908 numbered
1738, of whom 126 were graduates, 99 special students, and
500 women.<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The university library (with the library of the
law department) contained in 1908 about 107,000 volumes.
A marine biological laboratory, founded by Timothy Hopkins,
is maintained at Pacific Grove on the Bay of Monterey. The
university has an endowment from its founders estimated at
$30,000,000, including three great estates with 85,000 acres of
farm and vineyard lands, and several smaller tracts; but the
endowment was very largely in interest-bearing securities,
income from which was temporarily cut off in the early years
of the university&rsquo;s life by litigation. The founders wished the
university &ldquo;to qualify students for personal success and direct
usefulness in life; to promote the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization, teaching
the blessings of liberty regulated by law, and inculcating love
and reverence for the great principles of government as derived
from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.&rdquo; There are no inflexible entrance requirements
as to particular studies except English composition to ensure
a degree of mental maturity, the minimum amount of preparation
is fixed as that which should be given by four years in a secondary
school, leaving to the applicants a wide choice of subjects (35
in 1906) ranging from ancient history to woodworking and
machine shop. In the curriculum, liberty perhaps even greater
than at Harvard is allowed as to &ldquo;electives.&rdquo; Work on some
one major subject occupies about one-third of the undergraduate
course; the remaining two-thirds (or more) is purely elective.
The influence of sectarianism and politics is barred from the
university by its charter, and by its private origin and private
support. At the same time in its policy it is practically a state
university of the most liberal type. Instruction is entirely free.
The president of the university has the initiative in all appointments
and in all matters of general policy. Within the university
faculty power lies in an academic council, and, more particularly,
in an advisory board of nine professors, elected by the academic
council, to which all propositions of the president are submitted.
The growth of the university has been steady, and its conduct
careful. David Starr Jordan<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> was its first president.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LELEGES,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> the name applied by Greek writers to an early
people or peoples of which traces were believed to remain in
Greek lands.</p>

<p>1. <i>In Asia Minor.</i>&mdash;In Homer the Leleges are allies of the
Trojans, but they do not occur in the formal catalogue in <i>Iliad</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>
bk. ii., and their habitat is not specified. They are distinguished
from the Carians, with whom some later writers confused them;
they have a king Altes, and a town Pedasus which was sacked
by Achilles. The name Pedasus occurs (i.) near Cyzicus, (ii.)
in the Troad on the Satnioeis river, (iii.) in Caria, as well as
(iv.) in Messenia. Alcaeus (7th-6th centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) calls Antandrus
in the Troad Lelegian, but Herodotus (5th century)
substitutes Pelasgian (<i>q.v.</i>). Gargara in the Troad also counted
as Lelegian. Pherecydes (5th century) attributed to Leleges
the coast land of Caria from Ephesus to Phocaea, with the islands
of Samos and Chios, placing the &ldquo;true Carians&rdquo; farther south
from Ephesus to Miletus. If this statement be from Pherecydes
of Leros (<i>c.</i> 480) it has great weight. In the 4th century, however,
Philippus of Theangela in south Caria describes Leleges
still surviving as serfs of the true Carians, and Strabo, in the
1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, attributes to the Leleges a well-marked group
of deserted forts, tombs and dwellings which ranged (and can
still be traced) from the neighbourhood of Theangela and
Halicarnassus as far north as Miletus, the southern limit of
the &ldquo;true Carians&rdquo; of Pherecydes. Plutarch also implies the
historic existence of Lelegian serfs at Tralles in the interior.</p>

<p>2. <i>In Greece and the Aegean.</i>&mdash;A single passage in the Hesiodic
catalogue (fr. 136 Kinkel) places Leleges &ldquo;in Deucalion&rsquo;s time,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> as a primitive people, in Locris in central Greece. Not until
the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> does any other writer place them anywhere
west of the Aegean. But the confusion of the Leleges with the
Carians (immigrant conquerors akin to Lydians and Mysians,
and probably to Phrygians) which first appears in a Cretan
legend (quoted by Herodotus, but repudiated, as he says, by
the Carians themselves) and is repeated by Callisthenes, Apollodorus
and other later writers, led easily to the suggestion of
Callisthenes, that Leleges joined the Carians in their (half
legendary) raids on the coasts of Greece. Meanwhile other
writers from the 4th century onwards claimed to discover them
in Boeotia, west Acarnania (Leucas), and later again in Thessaly,
Euboea, Megara, Lacedaemon and Messenia. In Messenia they
were reputed immigrant founders of Pylos, and were connected
with the seafaring Taphians and Teleboans of Homer, and
distinguished from the Pelasgians; in Lacedaemon and in Leucas
they were believed to be aboriginal. These European Leleges
must be interpreted in connexion with the recurrence of place
names like Pedasus, Physcus, Larymna and Abae, (<i>a</i>) in Caria,
and (<i>b</i>) in the &ldquo;Lelegian&rdquo; parts of Greece; perhaps this is the
result of some early migration; perhaps it is also the cause
of these Lelegian theories.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Modern speculations (mainly corollaries of Indo-Germanic theory)
add little of value to the Greek accounts quoted above. H. Kiepert
(&ldquo;Über den Volksstamm der Leleges,&rdquo; in <i>Monatsber. Berl. Akad.</i>,
1861, p. 114) makes the Leleges an aboriginal people akin to Albanians
and Illyrians; K. W. Deimling, <i>Die Leleger</i> (Leipzig, 1862),
starts them in south-west Asia Minor, and brings them thence to
Greece (practically the Greek view); G. F. Unger, &ldquo;Hellas in Thessalien,&rdquo;
in <i>Philologus</i>, Suppl. ii. (1863), makes them Phoenician,
and derives their name from <span class="grk" title="lalazein">&#955;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> (cf. the names <span class="grk" title="barbaros">&#946;&#940;&#961;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>Wälsche</i>).
E. Curtius (<i>History of Greece</i>, i.) distinguished a &ldquo;Lelegian&rdquo; phase
of nascent Aegean culture. Most later writers follow Deimling.

of Hellenic Studies</i>, xvi. 188-270.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LELEWEL, JOACHIM<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (1786-1861), Polish historian, geographer
and numismatist, was born at Warsaw on the 22nd
of March 1786. His family came from Prussia in the early part
of the 18th century; his grandfather was appointed physician
to the reigning king of Poland, and his father caused himself
to be naturalized as a Polish citizen. The original form of the
name appears to have been Lölhöffel. Joachim was educated
at the university of Vilna, and became in 1807 a teacher in a
school at Krzemieniec in Volhynia, in 1814 teacher of history
at Vilna, and in 1818 professor and librarian at the university
of Warsaw. He returned to Vilna in 1821. His lectures enjoyed
great popularity, and enthusiasm felt for him by the students
is shown in the beautiful lines addressed to him by Mickiewicz.
But this very circumstance made him obnoxious to the Russian
government, and at Vilna Novosiltsev was then all-powerful.
Lelewel was removed from his professorship in 1824, and returned
to Warsaw, where he was elected a deputy to the diet in 1829.
He joined the revolutionary movement with more enthusiasm
than energy, and though the emperor Nicholas I. distinguished
him as one of the most dangerous rebels, did not appear to
advantage as a man of action. On the suppression of the
rebellion he made his way in disguise to Germany, and subsequently
reached Paris in 1831. The government of Louis
Philippe ordered him to quit French territory in 1833 at the
request of the Russian ambassador. The cause of this expulsion
is said to have been his activity in writing revolutionary proclamations.
He went to Brussels, where for nearly thirty years
he earned a scanty livelihood by his writings. He died on the
29th of May 1861 in Paris, whither he had removed a few days
previously.</p>

<p>Lelewel, a man of austere character, simple tastes and the
loftiest conception of honour, was a lover of learning for its
own sake. His literary activity was enormous, extending from
his <i>Edda Skandinawska</i> (1807) to his <i>Géographie des Arabes</i>
(2 vols., Paris, 1851). One of his most important publications
was <i>La Géographie du moyen âge</i> (5 vols., Brussels, 1852-1857),
with an atlas (1849) of plates entirely engraved by himself,
for he rightly attached such importance to the accuracy of his
maps that he would not allow them to be executed by any one
else. His works on Polish history are based on minute and critical
study of the documents; they were collected under the title
<i>Polska, dzieje i rzeczy jej rozpatrzywane</i> (<i>Poland, her History
and Affairs surveyed</i>), in 20 vols. (Posen, 1853-1876). He intended
to write a complete history of Poland on an extensive
scale, but never accomplished the task. His method is shown
in the little history of Poland, first published at Warsaw in
Polish in 1823, under the title <i>Dzieje Polski</i>, and afterwards
almost rewritten in the <i>Histoire de Pologne</i> (2 vols., Paris, 1844).
Other works on Polish history which may be especially mentioned
are <i>La Pologne au moyen âge</i> (3 vols., Posen, 1846-1851), an
edition of the <i>Chronicle of Matthew Cholewa</i><a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (1811) and <i>Ancient
Memorials of Polish Legislation</i> (<i>Ksiegi ustaw polskich i mazowieckich</i>).
He also wrote on the trade of Carthage, on Pytheas
of Marseilles, the geographer, and two important works on
numismatics (<i>La Numismatique du moyen âge</i>, Paris, 2 vols.,
1835; <i>Études numismatiques</i>, Brussels, 1840). While employed
in the university library of Warsaw he studied bibliography,
and the fruits of his labours may be seen in his <i>Bibliograficznych
Ksiag dwoje</i> (<i>A Couple of Books on Bibliography</i>) (2 vols., Vilna,
1823-1826). The characteristics of Lelewel as an historian are
great research and power to draw inferences from his facts;
his style is too often careless, and his narrative is not picturesque,
but his expressions are frequently terse and incisive.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He left valuable materials for a just comprehension of his career
in the autobiography (<i>Adventures while Prosecuting Researches and
Inquiries on Polish Matters</i>) printed in his <i>Polska</i>.</p>

born at Paris on the 19th of April 1665. He was a priest of the
Oratory, and was librarian to the establishment of the Order
in Paris, where he spent his life in seclusion. He died at Paris on
the 13th of August 1721. He first published a <i>Bibliotheca sacra</i>
(1709), an index of all the editions of the Bible, then a <i>Bibliothèque
historique de la France</i> (1719), a volume of considerable
size, containing 17,487 items to which Lelong sometimes appends
useful notes. His work is far from complete. He vainly hoped
that his friend and successor Father Desmolets, would continue
it; but it was resumed by Charles-Marie Fevret de Fontette,
a councillor of the parlement of Dijon, who spent fifteen
years of his life and a great deal of money in rewriting the
<i>Bibliothèque historique</i>. The first two volumes (1768 and 1769)
contained as many as 29,143 items. Fevret de Fontette died
on the 16th of February 1772, leaving the third volume almost
finished. It appeared in 1772, thanks to Barbaud de La Bruyère,
who later brought out the 4th and 5th volumes (1775 and 1778).

<p><span class="bold">LELY, SIR PETER<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (1617-1680) English painter, was born
at Soest, Westphalia, in 1617. His father, a military captain
and a native of Holland, was originally called van der Vaes;
the nickname of Le Lys or Lely, by which he was generally
known, was adopted by his son as a surname. After studying
for two years under Peter de Grebber, an artist of some note
at Haarlem, Lely, induced by the patronage of Charles I. for
the fine arts, removed to England in 1641. There he at first
painted historical subjects and landscape; he soon became so
eminent in his profession as to be employed by Charles to paint
his portrait shortly after the death of Vandyck. He afterwards
portrayed Cromwell. At the Restoration his genius and agreeable
manners won the favour of Charles II., who made him his state-painter,
and afterwards knighted him. He formed a famous
collection, the best of his time, containing drawings, prints and
paintings by the best masters; it sold by auction for no less
than £26,000. His great example, however, was Vandyck,
whom, in some of his most successful pieces, he almost rivals.
Lely&rsquo;s paintings are carefully finished, warm and clear in colouring,
and animated in design. The graceful posture of the heads,
the delicate rounding of the hands, and the broad folds of the
draperies are admired in many of his portraits. The eyes of
the ladies are drowsy with languid sentiment, and allegory
of a commonplace sort is too freely introduced. His most
famous work is a collection of portraits of the ladies of the court
of Charles II., known as &ldquo;the Beauties,&rdquo; formerly at Windsor
Castle, and now preserved at Hampton Court Palace. Of his
few historical pictures, the best is &ldquo;Susannah and the Elders,&rdquo;
at Burleigh House. His &ldquo;Jupiter and Europa,&rdquo; in the duke of
Devonshire&rsquo;s collection, is also worthy of note. Lely was nearly
as famous for crayon work as for oil-painting. Towards the close
of his life he often retired to an estate which he had bought at
Kew. He died of apoplexy in the Piazza, Covent Garden,
London, and was buried in Covent Garden church, where a
monument was afterwards erected to his memory. Pepys
characterized Lely as &ldquo;a mighty proud man and full of state.&rdquo;
The painter married an English lady of family, and left a son
and daughter, who died young. His only disciples were J.
Greenhill and J. Buckshorn; he did not, however, allow them
to obtain an insight into his special modes of work.</p>

of France, was born at Château du Loir, Sarthe. He was
ennobled in March 1401, and became six years later a councillor of
Louis II., duke of Anjou and king of Sicily. A partisan of the house
of Orleans, he was appointed chancellor to Isabella of Bavaria
on the 29th of January 1414, on the 20th of July commissary
of the mint, and in June 1416 chancellor to the count of Ponthieu,
afterwards Charles VII. On the 16th of August he bought the
barony of Trèves in Anjou, and henceforward bore the title of
seigneur of Trèves. When Paris was surprised by the Burgundians
on the night of the 29th of May 1418 he assisted Tanguy Duchâtel
in saving the dauphin. His devotion to the cause of the latter
having brought down on him the wrath of John the Fearless,
duke of Burgundy, he was excluded from the political amnesty
known as the peace of Saint Maur des Fossés, though he retained
his seat on the king&rsquo;s council. He was by the dauphin&rsquo;s side
when John the Fearless was murdered at the bridge of Montereau
on the 10th of September 1419. He resigned the seals at the
beginning of 1422; but he continued to exercise great influence,
and in 1426 he effected a reconciliation between the king and the
duke of Brittany. Having been captured by Jean de Langeac,
seneschal of Auvergne, in August of the same year, he was shut
up for three months in the château of Usson. When set at
liberty he returned to court, where he staunchly supported
Joan of Arc against all the cabals that menaced her. It was he
who signed the patent of nobility for the Arc family in December
1429. In 1430 he was once more entrusted with an embassy
to Brittany. Having retired from political life in 1436, he died
on the 28th of January 1443, and was interred at Trèves, where
his epitaph may still be seen.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE MAIRE DE BELGES, JEAN<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (1473-<i>c.</i> 1525), French poet
and historiographer, was born at Bavai in Hainault. He was
a nephew of Jean Molinet, and spent some time with him at
Valenciennes, where the elder writer held a kind of academy of
poetry. Le Maire in his first poems calls himself a disciple of
Molinet. In certain aspects he does belong to the school of the
<i>grands rhétoriqueurs</i>, but his great merit as a poet is that he
emancipated himself from the affectations and puerilities of his
masters. This independence of the Flemish school he owed
in part perhaps to his studies at the university of Paris and to the
study of the Italian poets at Lyons, a centre of the French
renascence. In 1503 he was attached to the court of Margaret of
Austria, duchess of Savoy, afterwards regent of the Netherlands.
For this princess he undertook more than one mission to Rome;
he became her librarian and a canon of Valenciennes. To her
were addressed his most original poems, <i>Epistres de l&rsquo;amand verd</i>,
the <i>amant vert</i> being a green parrot belonging to his patroness.
Le Maire gradually became more French in his sympathies,
eventually entering the service of Anne of Brittany. His prose
<i>Illustrations des Gaules et singularitez de Troye</i> (1510-1512),
largely adapted from Benoît de Sainte More, connects the Burgundian
royal house with Hector. Le Maire probably died before
1525. Étienne Pasquier, Ronsard and Du Bellay all acknowledged
their indebtedness to him. In his love for antiquity, his
sense of rhythm, and even the peculiarities of his vocabulary he
anticipated the <i>Pléiade</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His works were edited in 1882-1885 by J. Stecher, who wrote
the article on him in the <i>Biographie nationale de Belgique</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMAÎTRE, FRANÇOIS ÉLIE JULES<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (1853-&emsp;&emsp;), French
critic and dramatist, was born at Vennecy (Loiret) on the 27th
of April 1853. He became a professor at the university of
Grenoble, but he had already become known by his literary
criticisms, and in 1884 he resigned his position to devote himself
entirely to literature. He succeeded J. J. Weiss as dramatic
critic of the <i>Journal des Débats</i>, and subsequently filled the same
office on the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>. His literary studies were
collected under the title of <i>Les Contemporains</i> (7 series, 1886-1899),
and his dramatic <i>feuilletons as Impressions de théâtre</i>
(10 series, 1888-1898). His sketches of modern authors are
interesting for the insight displayed in them, the unexpectedness
of the judgments and the gaiety and originality of their expression.
He published two volumes of poetry: <i>Les Médaillons</i> (1880)
and <i>Petites orientales</i> (1883); also some volumes of <i>contes</i>,
among them <i>En marge des vieux livres</i> (1905). His plays are:
<i>Révoltée</i> (1889), <i>Le député Leveau</i>, and <i>Le Mariage blanc</i> (1891),
<i>Les Rois</i> (1893), <i>Le Pardon</i> and <i>L&rsquo;Age difficile</i> (1895), <i>La
Massière</i> (1905) and <i>Bertrade</i> (1906). He was admitted to the
French Academy on the 16th of January 1896. His political
views were defined in <i>La Campagne nationaliste</i> (1902), lectures
delivered in the provinces by him and by G. Cavaignac. He
conducted a nationalist campaign in the <i>Écho de Paris</i>, and was
for some time president of the Ligue de la Patrie Française, but
resigned in 1904, and again devoted himself to literature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE MANS,<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> a town of north-western France, capital of the
department of Sarthe, 77 m. S.W. of Chartres on the railway
from Paris to Brest. Pop. (1906) town, 54,907, commune,
65,467. It is situated just above the confluence of the Sarthe
and the Huisne, on an elevation rising from the left bank of the
Sarthe. Several bridges connect the old town and the new
quarters which have sprung up round it with the more extensive
quarter of Pré on the right bank. Modern thoroughfares are
gradually superseding the winding and narrow streets of old
houses; a tunnel connects the Place des Jacobins with the river
side. The cathedral, built in the highest part of the town, was
originally founded by St Julian, to whom it is dedicated. The
nave dates from the 11th and 12th centuries. In the 13th century
the choir was enlarged in the grandest and boldest style of that
period. The transepts, which are higher than the nave, were
rebuilt in the 15th century, and the bell-tower of the south
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
transept, the lower part of which is Romanesque, was rebuilt
in the 15th and 16th centuries. Some of the stained glass in
the nave, dating from the first half of the 12th century, is the
oldest in France; the west window, representing the legend of
St Julian, is especially interesting. The south lateral portal
(12th century) is richly decorated, and its statuettes exhibit
many costumes of the period. The austere simplicity of the older
part of the building is in striking contrast with the lavish richness
of the ornamentation in the choir, where the stained glass is
especially fine. The rose-window (15th century) of the north
transept, representing the Last Judgment, contains many
historical figures. The cathedral also has curious tapestries and
some remarkable tombs, including that of Berengaria, queen of
Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion. Close to the western wall is a megalithic
monument nearly 15 ft. in height. The church of La Couture,
which belonged to an old abbey founded in the 7th century by
St Bertrand, has a porch of the 13th century with fine statuary;
the rest of the building is older. The church of Notre-Dame du
Pré, on the right bank of the Sarthe, is Romanesque in style.
The hôtel de ville was built in 1756 on the site of the former
castle of the counts of Maine; the prefecture (1760) occupies
the site of the monastery of La Couture, and contains the library,
the communal archives, and natural history and art collections;
there is also an archaeological museum. Among the old houses
may be mentioned the Hôtel du Grabatoire of the Renaissance,
once a hospital for the canons and the so-called house of Queen
Berengaria (16th century), meeting place of the historical and
archaeological society of Maine. A monument to General
Chanzy commemorates the battle of Le Mans (1871). Le Mans
is the seat of a bishopric dating from the 3rd century, of a prefect,
and of a court of assizes, and headquarters of the IV. army corps.
It has also tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a council
of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce, a branch of the
Bank of France, an exchange, a lycée for boys, training colleges,
a higher ecclesiastical seminary and a school of music. The
town has a great variety of industries, carried on chiefly in the
southern suburb of Pontlieue. The more important are the state
manufacture of tobacco, the preparation of preserved vegetables,
fish, &amp;c., tanning, hemp-spinning, bell-founding, flour-milling,
the founding of copper and other metals, and the manufacture
of railway wagons, machinery and engineering material, agricultural
implements, rope, cloth and stained glass. The fattening
of poultry is an important local industry, and there is trade in
cattle, wine, cloth, farm-produce, &amp;c. The town is an important
railway centre.</p>

<p>As the capital of the Aulerci Cenomanni, Le Mans was called
Suindinum or Vindinum. The Romans built walls round it in
the 3rd century, and traces of them are still to be seen close to the
left bank of the river near the cathedral. In the same century
the town was evangelized by St Julian, who became its first
bishop. Ruled at first by his successors&mdash;notably St Aldric&mdash;Le
Mans passed in the middle ages to the counts of Maine (<i>q.v.</i>),
whose capital and residence it became. About the middle of
the 11th century the citizens secured a communal charter, but in
1063 the town was seized by William the Conqueror, who deprived
them of their liberties, which were recovered when the countship
of Maine had passed to the Plantagenet kings of England.
Le Mans was taken by Philip Augustus in 1189, recaptured by
John, subsequently confiscated and later ceded to Queen Berengaria,
who did much for its prosperity. It was several times
besieged in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1793 it was seized
by the Vendeans, who were expelled by the Republican generals
Marceau and Westermann after a stubborn battle in the streets.
In 1799 it was again occupied by the Chouans.</p>

<p>The battle of Le Mans (10th-12th January 1871) was the
culminating point of General Chanzy&rsquo;s fighting retreat into
western France after the winter campaign in Beauce and Perche
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franco-German War</a></span>). The numerous, but ill-trained and
ill-equipped, levies of the French were followed up by Prince
Frederick Charles with the German II. Army, now very much
weakened but consisting of soldiers who had in six months&rsquo;
active warfare acquired the self-confidence of veterans. The
Germans advanced with three army corps in first line and one
in reserve. On the 9th of January the centre corps (III.) drove
an advanced division of the French from Ardenay (13 m. E. of
Le Mans). On the 10th of January Chanzy&rsquo;s main defensive
position was approached. Its right wing was east of the Sarthe
and 3-5 m. from Le Mans, its centre on the heights of Anvours
with the river Huisne behind it, and its left scattered along the
western bank of the same river as far as Montfort (12 m. E.N.E.
of Le Mans) and thence northward for some miles. On the 10th
there was a severe struggle for the villages along the front of
the French centre. On the 11th Chanzy attempted a counter-offensive
from many points, but owing to the misbehaviour of
certain of his rawest levies, the Germans were able to drive him
back, and as their cavalry now began to appear beyond his
extreme left flank, he retreated in the night of the 11th on Laval,
the Germans occupying Le Mans after a brief rearguard fight on
the 12th.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE MARCHANT, JOHN GASPARD<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1766-1812), English
major-general, was the son of an officer of dragoons, John Le
Marchant, a member of an old Guernsey family. After a somewhat
wild youth, Le Marchant, who entered the army in 1781,
attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1797. Two years
before this he had designed a new cavalry sword; and in 1801
his scheme for establishing at High Wycombe and Great Marlow
schools for the military instruction of officers was sanctioned
by Parliament, and a grant of £30,000 was voted for the &ldquo;royal
military college,&rdquo; the two original departments being afterwards
combined and removed to Sandhurst. Le Marchant was the
first lieutenant-governor, and during the nine years that he held
this appointment he trained many officers who served with
distinction under Wellington in the Peninsula. Le Marchant
himself was given the command of a cavalry brigade in 1810, and
greatly distinguished himself in several actions, being killed
at the battle of Salamanca on the 22nd of July 1812, after the
charge of his brigade had had an important share in the English
victory. He wrote several treatises on cavalry tactics and other
military subjects, but few of them were published. By his wife,
Mary, daughter of John Carey of Guernsey, Le Marchant had
four sons and six daughters.</p>

<p>His second son, <span class="sc">Sir Denis le Marchant</span>, Bart. (1795-1874),
was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was
called to the bar in 1823. In 1830 he became secretary to Lord
Chancellor Brougham, and in the Reform Bill debates made
himself exceedingly useful to the ministers. Having been
secretary to the board of trade from 1836 to 1841, he was created
a baronet in 1841. He entered the House of Commons in 1846,
and was under secretary for the home department in the government
of Lord John Russell. He was chief clerk of the House of
Commons from 1850 to 1871. He published a <i>Life</i> of his father
in 1841, and began a <i>Life</i> of Lord Althorpe which was completed
after his death by his son; he also edited Horace Walpole&rsquo;s
<i>Memoirs of the Reign of George III.</i> (1845). Sir Denis Le
Marchant died in London on the 30th of October 1874.</p>

<p>The third son of General Le Marchant, <span class="sc">Sir John Gaspard
Le Marchant</span> (1803-1874), entered the English army, and saw
service in Spain in the Carlist War of 1835-37. He was afterwards
lieutenant-governor of Newfoundland (1847-1852) and
of Nova Scotia (1852-1857); governor of Malta (1859-1864);
commander-in-chief at Madras (1865-1868). He was made K.C.B.
in 1865, and died on the 6th of February 1874.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMBERG<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (Pol. <i>Lwów</i>, Lat. <i>Leopolis</i>), the capital of the
crownland of Galicia, Austria, 468 m. N.W. of Vienna by rail.
Pop. (1900) 159,618, of whom over 80% were Poles, 10%
Germans, and 8% Ruthenians; nearly 30% of the population
were Jews. According to population Lemberg is the fourth city
in the Austrian empire, coming after Vienna, Prague and Trieste.
Lemberg is situated on the small river Peltew, an affluent of the
Bug, in a valley in the Sarmatian plateau, and is surrounded
by hills. It is composed of the inner town and of four suburbs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>410</span>
The inner town was formerly fortified, but the fortifications were
transformed into pleasure grounds in 1811. Lemberg is the
residence of Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic and Armenian
archbishops, and contains three cathedrals. The Roman
Catholic cathedral was finished by Casimir IV. in 1480 in Gothic
style; near it is a chapel (1609) remarkable for its architecture
and sculpture. The Greek cathedral, built in 1740-1779 in the
Basilica style, is situated on a height which dominates the town.
The Armenian cathedral was built in 1437 in the Armenian-Byzantine
style. The Dominican church, built in 1749 after
the model of St Peter&rsquo;s at Rome, contains a monument by
Thorvaldsen to the Countess Dunin-Borkowska; the Greek
St Nicholas church was built in 1292; and the Roman Catholic
St Mary church was built in 1363 by the first German settlers.
The town hall (1828-1837) with a tower 250 ft. high is situated
in the middle of a square. Also notable are the hall of the
estates (1877-1881), the industrial museum, the theatre, the
palace of the Roman Catholic archbishop and several educational
establishments. There are many beautiful private buildings,
broad and well-paved streets, numerous squares and public
gardens. At the head of the educational institutions stands the
university, founded in 1784 by Joseph II., transformed into a
lycée in 1803, and restored and reorganized in 1817. Since 1871
the language of instruction has been Polish, and in 1901 the
university had 110 lecturers, and was attended by 2060 students.
There are also a polytechnic, gymnasia&mdash;for Poles, Ruthenians
and Germans respectively&mdash;seminaries for priests, training
colleges for teachers, and other special and technical schools.
In Lemberg is the National Institute founded by Count Ossolinski,
which contains a library of books and manuscripts relating
chiefly to the history and literature of Poland, valuable antiquarian
and scientific collections, and a printing establishment;
also the Dzieduszycki museum with collections of natural
history and ethnography relating chiefly to Galicia. Industrially
and commercially Lemberg is the most important city in Galicia,
its industries including the manufacture of machinery and iron
wares, matches, stearin candles and naphtha, arrack and liqueurs,
chocolate, chicory, leather and plaster of Paris, as well as brewing,
corn-milling and brick and tile making. It has important
commerce in linen, flax, hemp, wool and seeds, and a considerable
transit trade. Of the well-wooded hills which surround Lemberg,
the most important is the Franz-Josef-Berg to the N.E., with an
altitude of 1310 ft. Several beautiful parks have been laid
out on this hill.</p>

<p>Leopolis was founded about 1259 by the Ruthenian prince
Leo Danilowicz, who moved here his residence from Halicz in
1270. From Casimir the Great, who captured it in 1340, it
received the Magdeburg rights, and for almost two hundred
years the public records were kept in German. In 1412 it became
the see of a Roman Catholic archbishopric, and from 1432 until
1772 it was the capital of the Polish province of Reussen (<i>Terra
Russia</i>). During the whole period of Polish supremacy it was
a most important city, and after the fall of Constantinople it
greatly developed its trade with the East. In 1648 and 1655 it
was besieged by the Cossacks, and in 1672 by the Turks. Charles
XII. of Sweden captured it in 1704. In 1848 it was bombarded.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEMERCIER, LOUIS JEAN NÉPOMUCÉNE<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (1771-1840),
French poet and dramatist, was born in Paris on the 21st of
April 1771. His father had been intendant successively to the
duc de Penthièvre, the comte de Toulouse and the unfortunate
princesse de Lamballe, who was the boy&rsquo;s godmother. Lemercier
showed great precocity; before he was sixteen his tragedy
of <i>Méléagre</i> was produced at the <i>Théâtre Français</i>. <i>Clarissa
Harlowe</i> (1792) provoked the criticism that the author was not
<i>assez roué pour peindre les roueries</i>. <i>Le Tartufe révolutionnaire</i>,
a parody full of the most audacious political allusions, was
suppressed after the fifth representation. In 1795 appeared
Lemercier&rsquo;s masterpiece <i>Agamemnon</i>, called by Charles Labitte
the last great antique tragedy in French literature. It was a
great success, but was violently attacked later by Geoffroy,
who stigmatized it as a bad caricature of Crébillon. <i>Quatre
métamorphoses</i> (1799) was written to prove that the most indecent
subjects might be treated without offence. The <i>Pinto</i> (1800) was
the result of a wager that no further dramatic innovations were
possible after the comedies of Beaumarchais. It is a historical
comedy on the subject of the Portuguese revolution of 1640.
This play was construed as casting reflections on the first consul,
who had hitherto been a firm friend of Lemercier. His extreme
freedom of speech finally offended Napoleon, and the quarrel
proved disastrous to Lemercier&rsquo;s fortune for the time. None
of his subsequent work fulfilled the expectations raised by
<i>Agamemnon</i>, with the exception perhaps of <i>Frédégonde et
Brunéhaut</i> (1821). In 1810 he was elected to the Academy,
where he consistently opposed the romanticists, refusing to
give his vote to Victor Hugo. In spite of this, he has some
pretensions to be considered the earliest of the romantic school.
His <i>Christophe Colomb</i> (1809), advertised on the playbill as a
<i>comédie shakespirienne</i> (<i>sic</i>), represented the interior of a ship,
and showed no respect for the unities. Its numerous innovations
provoked such violent disturbances in the audience that one
person was killed and future representations had to be guarded
by the police. Lemercier wrote four long and ambitious epic
poems: <i>Homère</i>, <i>Alexandre</i> (1801), <i>L&rsquo;Atlantiade, ou la théogonie
newtonienne</i> (1812) and <i>Moïse</i> (1823), as well as an extraordinary
<i>Panhypocrisiade</i> (1819-1832), a distinctly romantic production
in twenty cantos, which has the sub-title <i>Spectacle infernal du
XVI<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i>. In it 16th-century history, with Charles V. and
Francis I. as principal personages, is played out on an imaginary
stage by demons in the intervals of their sufferings. Lemercier
died on the 7th of June 1840 in Paris.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEMERY, NICOLAS<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1645-1715), French chemist, was born at
Rouen on the 17th of November 1645. After learning pharmacy
in his native town he became a pupil of C. Glaser&rsquo;s in Paris, and
then went to Montpellier, where he began to lecture on chemistry.
He next established a pharmacy in Paris, still continuing his
lectures, but in 1683, being a Calvinist, he was obliged to retire
to England. In the following year he returned to France, and
turning Catholic in 1686 was able to reopen his shop and resume
his lectures. He died in Paris on the 19th of June 1715. Lemery
did not concern himself much with theoretical speculations,
but holding chemistry to be a demonstrative science, confined
himself to the straightforward exposition of facts and experiments.
In consequence, his lecture-room was thronged with people
of all sorts, anxious to hear a man who shunned the barren
obscurities of the alchemists, and did not regard the quest of
the philosopher&rsquo;s stone and the elixir of life as the sole end of his
science. Of his <i>Cours de chymie</i> (1675) he lived to see 13 editions,
and for a century it maintained its reputation as a standard
work. His other publications included <i>Pharmacopée universelle</i>
(1697), <i>Traité universel des drogues simples</i> (1698), <i>Traité de
l&rsquo;antimoine</i> (1707), together with a number of papers contributed
to the French Academy, one of which offered a chemical and
physical explanation of underground fires, earthquakes, lightning
and thunder. He discovered that heat is evolved when iron
filings and sulphur are rubbed together to a paste with water,
and the artificial <i>volcan de Lemery</i> was produced by burying
underground a considerable quantity of this mixture, which
he regarded as a potent agent in the causation of volcanic
action.</p>

<p>His son <span class="sc">Louis</span> (1677-1743) was appointed physician at the
Hôtel Dieu in 1710, and became demonstrator of chemistry at
the Jardin du Roi in 1731. He was the author of a <i>Traité des
aliments</i> (1702), and of a <i>Dissertation sur la nature des os</i> (1704),
as well as of a number of papers on chemical topics.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMGO,<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the principality of Lippe,
in a broad and fertile plain, 9 m. N. from Detmold and on
the railway Hameln-Lage. Pop. (1900) 8840. Its somewhat
gloomy aspect, enhanced by the tortuous narrow lanes flanked
by gabled houses of the 15th century, has gained for it among
countryfolk the sobriquet of the &ldquo;Witches&rsquo; nest&rdquo; (<i>Hexen-Nest</i>).
It is replete with interest for the antiquarian. It has four
Evangelical churches, two with curiously leaning, lead-covered
spires; an old town-hall; a gymnasium; and several philanthropic
and religious institutions. Among the latter is the
Jungfrauenstift, of which a princess of the reigning house of
Lippe-Detmold has always been lady superior since 1306. The
chief industry of Lemgo is the manufacture of meerschaum
pipes, which has attained here a high pitch of excellence; other
industries are weaving, brewing and the manufacture of leather
and cigars. The town was a member of the Hanseatic league.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMIERRE, ANTOINE MARIN<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1733-1793), French dramatist
and poet, was born in Paris on the 12th of January 1733.
His parents were poor, but Lemierre found a patron in the
collector-general of taxes, Dupin, whose secretary he became.
Lemierre gained his first success on the stage with <i>Hypermnestre</i>
(1758); <i>Térée</i> (1761) and <i>Idoménée</i> (1764) failed on account of
the subjects. <i>Artaxerce</i>, modelled on Metastasio, and <i>Guillaume
Tell</i> were produced in 1766; other successful tragedies were
<i>La Veuve de Malabar</i> (1770) and <i>Barnavelt</i> (1784). Lemierre
revived <i>Guillaume Tell</i> in 1786 with enormous success. After
the Revolution he professed great remorse for the production
of a play inculcating revolutionary principles, and there is no
doubt that the horror of the excesses he witnessed hastened his
death, which took place on the 4th of July 1793. He had been
admitted to the Academy in 1781. Lemierre published <i>La
Peinture</i> (1769), based on a Latin poem by the abbé de Marsy,
and a poem in six cantos, <i>Les Fastes, ou les usages de l&rsquo;année</i>
(1779), an unsatisfactory imitation of Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Fasti</i>.</p>

social reformer, was born at Vieux-Berquin (Nord) on the 23rd
of April 1853. He was educated at the college of St Francis of
Assisi, Hazebrouck, where he subsequently taught philosophy
and rhetoric. In 1897 he was elected deputy for Hazebrouck
and was returned unopposed at the elections of 1898, 1902 and
1906. He organized a society called <i>La Ligue du coin de terre et
du foyer</i>, the object of which was to secure, at the expense of the
state, a piece of land for every French family desirous of possessing
one. The abbé Lemire sat in the chamber of deputies as a
conservative republican and Christian Socialist. He protested
in 1893 against the action of the Dupuy cabinet in closing the
Bourse du Travail, characterizing it as the expression of &ldquo;a
policy of disdain of the workers.&rdquo; In December 1893 he was
seriously injured by the bomb thrown by the anarchist Vaillant

<p><span class="bold">LEMMING,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> the native name of a small Scandinavian rodent
mammal <i>Lemmus norvegicus</i> (or <i>L. lemmus</i>), belonging to the
mouse tribe, or <i>Muridae</i>, and nearly related, especially in the
structure of its cheek-teeth, to the voles. Specimens vary
considerably in size and colour, but the usual length is about
5 in., and the soft fur yellowish-brown, marked with spots of
dark brown and black. It has a short, rounded head, obtuse
muzzle, small bead-like eyes, and short rounded ears, nearly
concealed by the fur. The tail is very short. The feet are small,
each with five claws, those of the fore feet strongest, and fitted for
scratching and digging. The usual habitat of lemmings is the
high lands or fells of the great central mountain chain of Norway
and Sweden, from the southern branches of the Langfjeldene
in Christiansand <i>stift</i> to the North Cape and the Varangerfjord.
South of the Arctic circle they are, under ordinary circumstances,
confined to the plateaus covered with dwarf birch and juniper
above the conifer-region, though in Tromsö <i>amt</i> and in Finmarken
they occur in all suitable localities down to the level of the sea.
The nest, under a tussock of grass or a stone, is constructed of
short dry straws, and usually lined with hair. The number of
young in each nest is generally five, sometimes only three
occasionally seven or eight, and at least two broods are produced
annually. Their food is entirely vegetable, especially grass roots
and stalks, shoots of dwarf birch, reindeer lichens and mosses,
in search of which they form, in winter, long galleries through the
turf or under the snow. They are restless, courageous and
pugnacious little animals. When suddenly disturbed, instead
of trying to escape they sit upright, with their back against a
stone, hissing and showing fight in a determined manner.</p>

<p>The circumstance which has given popular interest to the
lemming is that certain districts of the cultivated lands of Norway
and Sweden, where in ordinary circumstances they are unknown,
are, at uncertain intervals varying from five to twenty or more
years, overrun by an army of these little creatures, which
steadily and slowly advance, always in the same direction, and
regardless of all obstacles, swimming streams and even lakes of
several miles in breadth, and committing considerable devastation
on their line of march by the quantity of food they consume.
In their turn they are pursued and harassed by crowds of beasts
and birds of prey, as bears, wolves, foxes, dogs, wild cats, stoats,
weasels, eagles, hawks and owls, and never spared by man;
even domestic animals, as cattle, goats and reindeer, join in the
destruction, stamping them to the ground with their feet, and
even eating their bodies. Numbers also die from diseases
produced apparently from overcrowding. None returns, and the
onward march of the survivors never ceases until they reach the
sea, into which they plunge, and swimming onwards in the same
direction perish in the waves. These sudden appearances of vast
bodies of lemmings, and their singular habit of persistently
pursuing the same onward course of migration, have given rise
to various speculations, from the ancient belief of the Norwegian
peasants, shared by Olaus Magnus, that they fall down from the
clouds, to the hypothesis that they are acting in obedience to
an instinct inherited from ancient times, and still seeking the
congenial home in the submerged Atlantis, to which their
ancestors of the Miocene period were wont to resort when driven
from their ordinary dwelling-places by crowding or scarcity of
food. The principal facts regarding these migrations seem to be
as follows. When any combination of circumstances has occasioned
an increase of the numbers of the lemmings in their
ordinary dwelling-places, impelled by the restless or migratory
instinct possessed in a less developed degree by so many of their
congeners, a movement takes place at the edge of the elevated
plateau, and a migration towards the lower-lying land begins.
The whole body moves forward slowly, always advancing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
same general direction in which they originally started, but
following more or less the course of the great valleys. They only
travel by night; and, staying in congenial places for considerable
periods, with unaccustomed abundance of provender, notwithstanding
the destructive influences to which they are exposed,
they multiply excessively during their journey, having families
more numerous and frequent than in their usual homes. The
progress may last from one to three years, according to the
route taken, and the distance to be traversed until the sea-coast
is reached, which in a country so surrounded by water as the
Scandinavian peninsula must be the ultimate goal of such a
journey. This may be either the Atlantic or the Gulf of Bothnia,
according as the migration has commenced from the west or the
east side of the central elevated plateau. Those that finally
perish in the sea, committing what appears to be a voluntary
suicide, are only acting under the same blind impulse which has
led them previously to cross shallower pieces of water with safety.
In Eastern Europe, Northern Asia and North America the group
is represented by the allied <i>L. obensis</i>, and in Alaska, by <i>L.
nigripes</i>; while the circumpolar banded lemming, <i>Dicrostonyx
torquatus</i>, which turns white in winter, represents a second genus
taking its name from the double claws on one of the toes of the
forefeet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMNISCATE<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="lêmniskos">&#955;&#951;&#956;&#957;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, ribbon), a quartic curve
invented by Jacques Bernoulli (<i>Acta Eruditorum</i>, 1694) and
afterwards investigated by Giulio Carlo Fagnano, who gave its
principal properties and applied it to effect the division of a
quadrant into 2.2<span class="sp">m</span>, 3.2<span class="sp">m</span> and 5.2<span class="sp">m</span> equal parts. Following
Archimedes, Fagnano desired the curve to be engraved on his
tombstone. The complete analytical treatment was first given
by Leonhard Euler. The lemniscate of Bernoulli may be defined
as the locus of a point which moves so that the product of its
distances from two fixed points is constant and is equal to the
square of half the distance between these points. It is therefore
a particular form of Cassini&rsquo;s oval (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oval</a></span>). Its cartesian
equation, when the line joining the two fixed points is the axis
of x and the middle point of this line is the origin, is (x<span class="sp">2</span> + y<span class="sp">2</span>)<span class="sp">2</span> =
2a<span class="sp">2</span>(x<span class="sp">2</span> &minus; y<span class="sp">2</span>) and the polar equation is r<span class="sp">2</span> = 2a<span class="sp">2</span> cos 2&theta;. The curve
(fig. 1) consists of two loops symmetrically placed about the
coordinate axes. The pedal equation is r<span class="sp">3</span> = a<span class="sp">2</span>p, which shows
that it is the first positive pedal of a rectangular hyperbola with
regard to the centre. It is also the inverse of the same curve for
the same point. It is the envelope of circles described on the
central radii of an ellipse as diameters. The area of the complete
curve is 2a<span class="sp">2</span>, and the length of any arc may be expressed in the
form &int; (1 &minus; x<span class="sp">4</span>)<span class="sp">&minus;1/2</span>dx, an elliptic integral sometimes termed the
<i>lemniscatic integral</i>.</p>

<p>The name lemniscate is sometimes given to any crunodal quartic
curve having only one real finite branch which is symmetric about
the axis. Such curves are given by the equation x<span class="sp">2</span> &minus; y<span class="sp">2</span> = ax<span class="sp">4</span> +
bx<span class="sp">2</span>y<span class="sp">2</span> + cy<span class="sp">4</span>. If a be greater than b the curve resembles fig. 2 and
is sometimes termed the <i>fishtail-lemniscate</i>; if a be less than b, the
curve resembles fig.
3. The same name
is also given to the
first positive pedal
of any central conic.
When the conic is a
rectangular hyperbola,
the curve is
the lemniscate of
Bernoulli previously described. The <i>elliptic lemniscate</i> has for its
equation (x<span class="sp">2</span> + y<span class="sp">2</span>)<span class="sp">2</span> = a<span class="sp">2</span>x<span class="sp">2</span> + b<span class="sp">2</span>y<span class="sp">2</span> or r<span class="sp">2</span> = a<span class="sp">2</span> cos<span class="sp">2</span>&theta; + b<span class="sp">2</span> sin<span class="sp">2</span>&theta; (a &gt; b). The
centre is a conjugate point (or acnode) and the curve resembles
fig. 4. The <i>hyperbolic lemniscate</i> has for its equation (x<span class="sp">2</span> + y<span class="sp">2</span>)<span class="sp">2</span> = a<span class="sp">2</span>x<span class="sp">2</span>

and the curve resembles fig. 5. These curves are instances of
unicursal bicircular quartics.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMNOS<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (mod. <i>Limnos</i>), an island in the northern part of
the Aegean Sea. The Italian form of the name, Stalimene,
<i>i.e.</i> <span class="grk" title="es tên Lêmnon">&#7952;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#923;&#8134;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>, is not used in the island itself, but is commonly
employed in geographical works. The island, which belongs
to Turkey, is of considerable size: Pliny says that the coast-line
measured 112½ Roman miles, and the area has been estimated
at 150 sq. m. Great part is mountainous, but some very fertile
valleys exist, to cultivate which 2000 yoke of oxen are
employed. The hill-sides afford pasture for 20,000 sheep. No
forests exist on the island; all wood is brought from the coast
of Rumelia or from Thasos. A few mulberry and fruit trees
grow, but no olives. The population is estimated by some
as high as 27,000, of whom 2000 are Turks and the rest Greeks,
but other authorities doubt whether it reaches more than half
this number. The chief towns are Kastro on the western coast,
with a population of 4000 Greeks and 800 Turks, and Mudros on
the southern coast. Kastro possesses an excellent harbour, and
is the seat of all the trade carried on with the island. Greek,
English and Dutch consuls or consular agents were formerly
stationed there; but the whole trade is now in Greek hands.
The archbishops of Lemnos and Ai Strati, a small neighbouring
island with 2000 inhabitants, resides in Kastro. In ancient
times the island was sacred to Hephaestus, who as the legend
tells fell on Lemnos when his father Zeus hurled him headlong
out of Olympus. This tale, as well as the name Aethaleia,
sometimes applied to it, points to its volcanic character. It is
said that fire occasionally blazed forth from Mosychlos, one of
its mountains; and Pausanias (viii. 33) relates that a small
island called Chryse, off the Lemnian coast, was swallowed up
by the sea. All volcanic action is now extinct.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The most famous product of Lemnos is the medicinal earth, which
is still used by the natives. At one time it was popular over western
Europe under the name <i>terra sigillata</i>. This name, like the Gr.
<span class="grk" title="Lêmnia sphragis">&#923;&#951;&#956;&#957;&#943;&#945; &#963;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#962;</span>, is derived from the stamp impressed on each piece
of the earth; in ancient times the stamp was the head of Artemis.
The Turks now believe that a vase of this earth destroys the effect
of any poison drunk from it&mdash;a belief which the ancients attached
rather to the earth from Cape Kolias in Attica. Galen went to see
the digging up of this earth (see Kuhn, <i>Medic. Gr. Opera</i>, xii. 172 sq.);
on one day in each year a priestess performed the due ceremonies,
and a waggon-load of earth was dug out. At the present time the
day selected is the 6th of August, the feast of Christ the Saviour.
Both the Turkish <i>hodja</i> and the Greek priest are present to perform
the necessary ceremonies; the whole process takes place before
daybreak. The earth is sold by apothecaries in stamped cubical
blocks. The hill from which the earth is dug is a dry mound, void of
vegetation, beside the village of Kotschinos, and about two hours
from the site of Hephaestia. The earth was considered in ancient
times a cure for old festering wounds, and for the bite of poisonous
snakes.</p>
</div>

<p>The name Lemnos is said by Hecataeus (<i>ap.</i> Steph. Byz.) to
have been a title of Cybele among the Thracians, and the earliest
inhabitants are said to have been a Thracian tribe, called by
the Greeks Sinties, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;the robbers.&rdquo; According to a famous
legend the women were all deserted by their husbands, and in
revenge murdered every man on the island. From this barbarous
act, the expression Lemnian deeds, <span class="grk" title="Lêmnia erga">&#923;&#942;&#956;&#957;&#953;&#945; &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#945;</span>, became proverbial.
The Argonauts landing soon after found only women
in the island, ruled over by Hypsipyle, daughter of the old king
Thoas. From the Argonauts and the Lemnian women were
descended the race called Minyae, whose king Euneus, son of
Jason and Hypsipyle, sent wine and provisions to the Greeks
at Troy. The Minyae were expelled by a Pelasgian tribe who
came from Attica. The historical element underlying these
traditions is probably that the original Thracian people were
gradually brought into communication with the Greeks as
navigation began to unite the scattered islands of the Aegean
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jason</a></span>); the Thracian inhabitants were barbarians in
comparison with the Greek mariners. The worship of Cybele
was characteristic of Thrace, whither it spread from Asia Minor
at a very early period, and it deserves notice that Hypsipyle
and Myrina (the name of one of the chief towns) are Amazon
names, which are always connected with Asiatic Cybele-worship.
Coming down to a better authenticated period, we find that
Lemnos was conquered by Otanes, one of the generals of Darius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
Hystaspis; but was soon reconquered by Miltiades, the tyrant
of the Thracian Chersonese. Miltiades afterwards returned to
Athens, and Lemnos continued an Athenian possession till the
Macedonian empire absorbed it. On the vicissitudes of its
history in the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> see Köhler in <i>Mittheil. Inst.
Athen.</i> i. 261. The Romans declared it free in 197 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but
gave it over in 166 to Athens, which retained nominal possession
of it till the whole of Greece was made a Roman province. A
colony of Attic cleruchs was established by Pericles, and many
inscriptions on the island relate to Athenians. After the division
of the empire, Lemnos passed under the Byzantine emperors;
it shared in the vicissitudes of the eastern provinces, being
alternately in the power of Greeks, Italians and Turks, till
finally the Turkish sultans became supreme in the Aegean.
In 1476 the Venetians successfully defended Kotschinos against
a Turkish siege; but in 1657 Kastro was captured by the Turks
from the Venetians after a siege of sixty-three days. Kastro
was again besieged by the Russians in 1770.</p>

<p>Homer speaks as if there were one town in the island called
Lemnos, but in historical times there was no such place. There
were two towns, Myrina, now Kastro, and Hephaestia. The
latter was the chief town; its coins are found in considerable
number, the types being sometimes the Athenian goddess and
her owl, sometimes native religious symbols, the caps of the
Dioscuri, Apollo, &amp;c. Few coins of Myrina are known. They
belong to the period of Attic occupation, and bear Athenian
types. A few coins are also known which bear the name, not
of either city, but of the whole island. Conze was the first to
discover the site of Hephaestia, at a deserted place named
Palaeokastro on the east coast. It had once a splendid harbour,
which is now filled up. Its situation on the east explains why
Miltiades attacked it first when he came from the Chersonese.
It surrendered at once, whereas Myrina, with its very strong
citadel built on a perpendicular rock, sustained a siege. It
is said that the shadow of Mount Athos fell at sunset on a bronze
cow in the agora of Myrina. Pliny says that Athos was 87 m.
to the north-west; but the real distance is about 40 English
miles. One legend localized in Lemnos still requires notice.
Philoctetes was left there by the Greeks on their way to Troy;
and there he suffered ten years&rsquo; agony from his wounded foot,
until Ulysses and Neoptolemus induced him to accompany them
to Troy. He is said by Sophocles to have lived beside Mount
Hermaeus, which Aeschylus (<i>Agam.</i> 262) makes one of the
beacon points to flash the news of Troy&rsquo;s downfall home to
Argos.</p>

1815. He was educated first at an English school and then in
France. In 1840 he began writing for the <i>Journal des débats</i>,
on English and other foreign questions, and under the empire
he held up to admiration the free institutions of England by
contrast with imperial methods. After 1871 he supported
Thiers, but his sympathies rather tended towards a liberalized
monarchy, until the comte de Chambord&rsquo;s policy made such a
development an impossibility, and he then ranged himself with
the moderate Republicans. In 1875 Lemoinne was elected to
the French Academy, and in 1880 he was nominated a life senator.
Distinguished though he was for a real knowledge of England
among the French journalists who wrote on foreign affairs, his
tone towards English policy greatly changed in later days,
and though he never shared the extreme French bitterness
against England as regards Egypt, he maintained a critical
attitude which served to stimulate French Anglophobia. He
was a frequent contributor to the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>,
and published several books, the best known of which is his
<i>Études critiques et biographiques</i> (1862). He died in Paris on

<p><span class="bold">LEMON, MARK<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (1809-1870), editor of <i>Punch</i>, was born in
London on the 30th of November 1809. He had a natural talent
for journalism and the stage, and, at twenty-six, retired from less
congenial business to devote himself to the writing of plays.
More than sixty of his melodramas, operettas and comedies were
produced in London. At the same time he contributed to a
variety of magazines and newspapers, and founded and edited
the <i>Field</i>. In 1841 Lemon and Henry Mayhew conceived the
idea of a humorous weekly paper to be called <i>Punch</i>, and when
the first number was issued, in July 1841, were joint-editors and,
with the printer and engraver, equal owners. The paper was
for some time unsuccessful, Lemon keeping it alive out of the
profits of his plays. On the sale of <i>Punch</i> Lemon became sole
editor for the new proprietors, and it remained under his control
until his death, achieving remarkable popularity and influence.
Lemon was an actor of ability, a pleasing lecturer and a successful
impersonator of Shakespearian characters. He also wrote
a host of novelettes and lyrics, over a hundred songs, a few
three-volume novels, several Christmas fairy tales and a volume
of jests. He died at Crawley, Sussex, on the 23rd of May 1870.</p>

<p class="pt2">The lemon seems to have been unknown to the ancient
Greeks and Romans, and to have been introduced by the Arabs
into Spain between the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1494 the
fruit was cultivated in the Azores, and largely shipped to England,
but since 1838 the exportation has ceased. As a cultivated plant
the lemon is now met with throughout the Mediterranean region,
in Spain and Portugal, in California and Florida, and in almost
all tropical and subtropical countries. Like the apple and pear,
it varies exceedingly under cultivation. Risso and Poiteau
enumerate forty-seven varieties of this fruit, although they
maintain as distinct the sweet lime, <i>C. Limetta</i>, with eight
varieties, and the sweet lemon, <i>C. Lumia</i>, with twelve varieties,
which differ only in the fruit possessing an insipid instead of an
acid juice.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The lemon is more delicate than the orange, although, according
to Humboldt, both require an annual mean temperature of 62° Fahr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
Unlike the orange, which presents a fine close head of deep green
foliage, it forms a straggling bush, or small tree, 10 to 12 ft. high,
with paler, more scattered leaves, and short angular branches with
sharp spines in the axils. The flowers, which possess a sweet odour
quite distinct from that of the orange, are in part hermaphrodite
and in part unisexual, the outside of the corolla having a purplish
hue. The fruit, which is usually crowned with a nipple, consists of
an outer rind or peel, the surface of which is more or less rough
from the convex oil receptacles imbedded in it, and of a white inner
rind, which is spongy and nearly tasteless, the whole of the interior
of the fruit being filled with soft parenchymatous tissue, divided
into about ten to twelve compartments, each generally containing
two or three seeds. The white inner rind varies much in thickness
in different kinds, but is never so thick as in the citron. As lemons
are much more profitable to grow than oranges, on account of their
keeping properties, and from their being less liable to injury during
voyages, the cultivation of the lemon is preferred in Italy wherever
it will succeed. In damp valleys it is liable like the orange (<i>q.v.</i>)
to be attacked by a fungus sooty mould, the stem, leaves, and fruit
becoming covered with a blackish dust. This is coincident with or
subsequent to the attacks of a small oval brown insect, <i>Chermes
hesperidum</i>. Trees not properly exposed to sunlight and air suffer
most severely from these pests. Syringing with resin-wash or milk
of lime when the young insects are hatched, and before they have
fixed themselves to the plant, is a preventive. Since 1875 this fungoid
disease has made great ravages in Sicily among the lemon and citron
trees, especially around Catania and Messina. Heritte attributes
the prevalence of the disease to the fact that the growers have
induced an unnatural degree of fertility in the trees, permitting
them to bear enormous crops year after year. This loss of vitality
is in some measure met by grafting healthy scions of the lemon on
the bitter orange, but trees so grafted do not bear fruit until they
are eight or ten years old.</p>
</div>

<p>The lemon tree is exceedingly fruitful, a large one in Spain or
Sicily ripening as many as three thousand fruits in favourable
seasons. In the south of Europe lemons are collected more or
less during every month of the year, but in Sicily the chief
harvest takes place from the end of October to the end of
December, those gathered during the last two months of the year
being considered the best for keeping purposes. The fruit is
gathered while still green. After collection the finest specimens
are picked out and packed in cases, each containing about four
hundred and twenty fruits, and also in boxes, three of which are
equal to two cases, each lemon being separately packed in paper.
The remainder, consisting of ill-shaped or unsound fruits, are
reserved for the manufacture of essential oil and juice. The
whole of the sound lemons are usually packed in boxes, but those
which are not exported immediately are carefully picked over
and the unsound ones removed before shipment. The exportation
is continued as required until April and May. The large
lemons with a rougher rind, which appear in the London market
in July and August, are grown at Sorrento near Naples, and are
allowed to remain on the trees until ripe.</p>

<p>Candied lemon peel is usually made in England from a larger
variety of the lemon cultivated in Sicily on higher ground than
the common kind, from which it is distinguished by its thicker
rind and larger size. This kind, known as the Spadaforese
lemon, is also allowed to remain on the trees until ripe, and when
gathered the fruit is cut in half longitudinally and pickled in
brine, before being exported in casks. Before candying the
lemons are soaked in fresh water to remove the salt. Citrons
are also exported from Sicily in the same way, but these are
about six times as expensive as lemons, and a comparatively
small quantity is shipped. Besides those exported from Messina
and Palermo, lemons are also imported into England to a less
extent from the Riviera of Genoa, and from Malaga in Spain,
the latter being the most esteemed. Of the numerous varieties
the wax lemon, the imperial lemon and the Gaeta lemon are
considered to be the best. Lemons are also extensively grown
in California and Florida.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lemons of ordinary size contain about 2 oz. of juice, of specific
gravity 1.039-1.046, yielding on an average 32.5 to 42.53 grains of
citric acid per oz. The amount of this acid, according to Stoddart,
varies in different seasons, decreasing in lemons kept from February
to July, at first slowly and afterwards rapidly, until at the end of
that period it is all split up into glucose and carbonic acid&mdash;the
specific gravity of the juice being in February 1.046, in May 1.041
and in July 1.027, while the fruit is hardly altered in appearance.
It has been stated that lemons may be kept for some months with
scarcely perceptible deterioration by varnishing them with an
alcoholic solution of shellac&mdash;the coating thus formed being easily
removed when the fruit is required for household use by gently
kneading it in the hands. Besides citric acid, lemon juice contains
3 to 4% of gum and sugar, albuminoid matters, malic acid and
2.28% of inorganic salts. Cossa has determined that the ash of
dried lemon juice contains 54% of potash, besides 15% of phosphoric
acid. In the white portion of the peel (in common with other fruits
of the genus) a bitter principle called <i>hesperidin</i> has been found. It
is very slightly soluble in boiling water, but is soluble in dilute
alcohol and in alkaline solutions, which it soon turns of a yellow or
reddish colour. It is also darkened by tincture of perchloride of
iron. Another substance named <i>lemonin</i>, crystallizing in lustrous
plates, was discovered in 1879 by Palerno and Aglialoro in the seeds,
in which it is present in very small quantity, 15,000 grains of seed
yielding only 80 grains of it. It differs from hesperidin in dissolving
in potash without alteration. It melts at 275° F.</p>

<p>The simplest method of preserving lemon juice in small quantities
for medicinal or domestic use is to keep it covered with a layer of
olive or almond oil in a closed vessel furnished with a glass tap, by
which the clear liquid may be drawn off as required. Lemon juice
is largely used on shipboard as a preventive of scurvy. By the
Merchant Shipping Act 1867 every British ship going to other
countries where lemon or lime juice cannot be obtained was required
to take sufficient to give 1 oz. to every member of the crew daily.
Of this juice it requires about 13,000 lemons to yield l pipe (108
gallons). Sicilian juice in November yields about 9 oz. of crude
citric acid per gallon, but only 6 oz. if the fruit is collected in April.
The crude juice was formerly exported to England, and was often
adulterated with sea-water, but is now almost entirely replaced by
lime juice. A concentrated lemon juice for the manufacture of
citric acid is prepared in considerable quantities, chiefly at Messina
and Palermo, by boiling down the crude juice in copper vessels
over an open fire until its specific gravity is about 1.239, seven to
ten pipes of raw making only one of concentrated lemon juice.
&ldquo;Lemon juice&rdquo; for use on shipboard is prepared also from the
fruits of limes and Bergamot oranges. It is said to be sometimes
adulterated with sulphuric acid on arrival in England.</p>

<p>The lemon used in medicine is described in the British pharmacopoeia
as being the fruit of <i>Citrus medica</i>, var. Limonum. The
preparations of lemon peel are of small importance. From the
fresh peel is obtained the <i>oleum limonis</i> (dose ½-3 minims), which
has the characters of its class. It contains a terpene known as
citrene or limonene, which also occurs in orange peel: and citral,
the aldehyde of geraniol, which is the chief constituent of oil of
roses. Of much importance is the <i>succus limonis</i> or lemon juice, 1
oz. of which contains about 40 grains of free citric acid, besides
the citrate of potassium (.25%) and malic acid, free and combined.
Ten per cent. of alcohol must be added to lemon juice if it is to be
kept. From it are prepared the <i>syrupus limonis</i> (dose ½-2 drachms),
which consists of sugar, lemon juice and an alcoholic extract of
lemon peel, and also citric acid itself. Lemon juice is practically
impure citric acid (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><i>Essence or Essential Oil of Lemon.</i>&mdash;The essential oil contained in
the rind of the lemon occurs in commerce as a distinct article. It
is manufactured chiefly in Sicily, at Reggio in Calabria, and at
Mentone and Nice in France. The small and irregularly shaped
fruits are employed while still green, in which state the yield of oil
is greater than when they are quite ripe. In Sicily and Calabria
the oil is extracted in November and December as follows. A
workman cuts three longitudinal slices off each lemon, leaving a
three-cornered central core having a small portion of rind at the apex
and base. These pieces are then divided transversely and cast on one
side, and the strips of peel are thrown in another place. Next day
the pieces of peel are deprived of their oil by pressing four or five
times successively the outer surface of the peel (zest or flavedo) bent
into a convex shape, against a flat sponge held in the palm of the
left hand and wrapped round the forefinger. The oil vesicles in
the rind, which are ruptured more easily in the fresh fruit than in
the state in which lemons are imported, yield up their oil to the
sponge, which when saturated is squeezed into an earthen vessel
furnished with a spout and capable of holding about three pints.
After a time the oil separates from the watery liquid which accompanies
it, and is then decanted. By this process four hundred fruits
yield 9 to 14 oz. of essence. The prisms of pulp are afterwards
expressed to obtain lemon juice, and then distilled to obtain the
small quantity of volatile oil they contain. At Mentone and Nice
a different process is adopted. The lemons are placed in an <i>écuelle
à piquer</i>, a shallow basin of pewter about 8½ in. in diameter, having
i a lip for pouring on one side and a closed tube at the bottom about
5 in. long and 1 in. in diameter. A number of stout brass pins stand
up about half an inch from the bottom of the vessel. The workman
rubs a lemon over these pins, which rupture the oil vesicles, and the
oil collects in the tube, which when it becomes full is emptied into
another vessel that it may separate from the aqueous liquid mixed
with it. When filtered it is known as <i>Essence de citron au zeste</i>, or,
in the English market, as perfumers&rsquo; essence of lemon, inferior
qualities being distinguished as druggists&rsquo; essence of lemon. An
additional product is obtained by immersing the scarified lemons in
warm water and separating the oil which floats off. <i>Essence de
citron distillée</i> is obtained by rubbing the surface of fresh lemons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>
(or of those which have been submitted to the action of the <i>écuelle
à piquer</i>) on a coarse grater of tinned iron, and distilling the grated
peel. The oil so obtained is colourless, and of inferior fragrance,
and is sold at a lower price, while that obtained by the cold processes
has a yellow colour and powerful odour.</p>

<p>Essence of lemon is chiefly brought from Messina and Palermo
packed in copper bottles holding 25 to 50 kilogrammes or more, and
sometimes in tinned bottles of smaller size. It is said to be rarely
found in a state of purity in commerce, almost all that comes into
the market being diluted with the cheaper distilled oil. This fact
may be considered as proved by the price at which the essence of
lemon is sold in England, this being less than it costs the manufacturer
to make it. When long kept the essence deposits a white
greasy stearoptene, apparently identical with the bergaptene
obtained from the essential oil of the Bergamot orange. The chief
constituent of oil of lemon is the terpene, C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">16</span>, boiling at 348°.8
Fahr., which, like oil of turpentine, readily yields crystals of terpin,
C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">16</span>3OH<span class="su">2</span>, but differs in yielding the crystalline compound,
C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">16</span> + 2Cl, oil of turpentine forming one having the formula
C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">16</span> + HCl. Oil of lemons also contains, according to Tilden,
another hydrocarbon, C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">16</span>, boiling at 3.20° Fahr., a small amount
of <i>cymene</i>, and a compound acetic ether, C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">3</span>O·C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">17</span>O. The
natural essence of lemon not being wholly soluble in rectified spirit
of wine, an essence for culinary purposes is sometimes prepared by
digesting 6 oz of lemon peel in one pint of pure alcohol of 95%, and,
when the rind has become brittle, which takes place in about two
and a half hours, powdering it and percolating the alcohol through
it. This article is known as &ldquo;lemon flavour.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The name lemon is also applied to some other fruits. The Java
lemon is the fruit of <i>Citrus javanica</i>, the pear lemon of a variety
of <i>C. Limetta</i>, and the pearl lemon of <i>C. margarita</i>. The fruit of
a passion-flower, <i>Passiflora laurifolia</i>, is sometimes known as the
water-lemon, and that of a Berberidaceous plant, <i>Podophyllum
peltatum</i>, as the wild lemon. In France and Germany the lemon
is known as the citron, and hence much confusion arises concerning
the fruits referred to in different works. The essential oil
known as oil of cedrat is usually a factitious article instead of
being prepared, as its name implies, from the citron (Fr. <i>cédratier</i>).
An essential oil is also prepared from <i>C. Lumia</i>, at Squillace in
Calabria, and has an odour like that of Bergamot but less
powerful.</p>

<p class="pt2">The sour lime is <i>Citrus acida</i>, generally regarded as a var.
(<i>acida</i>) of <i>C. medica</i>. It is a native of India, ascending to about
4000 ft. in the mountains, and occurring as a small, much-branched
thorny bush. The small flowers are white or tinged with pink
on the outside; the fruit is small and generally round, with a thin,
light green or lemon-yellow bitter rind, and a very sour, somewhat
bitter juicy pulp. It is extensively cultivated throughout the
West Indies, especially in Dominica, Montserrat and Jamaica,
the approximate annual value of the exports from these islands
being respectively £45,000, £6000 and £6000. The plants are
grown from seed in nurseries and planted out about 200 to the
acre. They begin to bear from about the third year, but full
crops are not produced until the trees are six or seven years old.
The ripe yellow fruit is gathered as it falls. The fruit is bruised
by hand in a funnel-shaped vessel known as an <i>écuelle</i>, with a
hollow stem; by rolling the fruit on a number of points on the
side of the funnel the oil cells in the rind are broken and the oil
collects in the hollow stem&mdash;this is the essential oil or essence of
limes. The fruits are then taken to the mill, sorted, washed and
passed through rollers and exposed to two squeezings. Two-thirds
of the juice is expressed by the first squeezing, is strained at
once, done up in puncheons and exported as raw juice. The product
of the second squeezing, together with the juice extracted
by a subsequent squeezing in a press, is strained and evaporated
down to make concentrated juice; ten gallons of the raw juice
yield one gallon of the concentrated juice. The raw juice is
used for preparations of lime juice cordial, the concentrated for
manufactures of citric acid.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>On some estates citrate of lime is now manufactured in place of
concentrated acid. Distilled oil of limes is prepared by distilling
the juice, but its value is low in comparison with the expressed oil
obtained by hand as described above. Green limes and pickled
limes preserved in brine are largely exported to the United States,
and more recently green limes have been exported to the United
Kingdom. Limalade or preserved limes is an excellent substitute
for marmalade. A spineless form of the lime appeared as a sport in
Dominica in 1892, and is now grown there and elsewhere on a
commercial scale. A form with seedless fruits has also recently been
obtained in Dominica and Trinidad independently. The young
leaves of the lime are used for perfuming the water in finger-glasses,
a few being placed in the water and bruised before use.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMONNIER, ANTOINE LOUIS CAMILLE<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1844-&emsp;&emsp;),
Belgian poet, was born at Ixelles, Brussels, on the 24th of March
1844. He studied law, and then took a clerkship in a government
office, which he resigned after three years. Lemonnier inherited
Flemish blood from both parents, and with it the animal force
and pictorial energy of the Flemish temperament. He published
a <i>Salon de Bruxelles</i> in 1863, and again in 1866. His early friendships
were chiefly with artists; and he wrote art criticisms
with recognized discernment. Taking a house in the hills near
Namur, he devoted himself to sport, and developed the intimate
sympathy with nature which informs his best work. <i>Nos
Flamands</i> (1869) and <i>Croquis d&rsquo;automne</i> (1870) date from this
time. <i>Paris-Berlin</i> (1870), a pamphlet pleading the cause of
France, and full of the author&rsquo;s horror of war, had a great
success. His capacity as a novelist, in the fresh, humorous
description of peasant life, was revealed in <i>Un Coin de village</i>
(1879). In <i>Un Mâle</i> (1881) he achieved a different kind of success.
It deals with the amours of a poacher and a farmer&rsquo;s daughter,
with the forest as a background. Cachaprès, the poacher,
seems the very embodiment of the wild life around him. The
rejection of <i>Un Mâle</i> by the judges for the quinquennial prize
of literature in 1883 made Lemonnier the centre of a school,
inaugurated at a banquet given in his honour on the 27th of May
1883. <i>Le Mort</i> (1882), which describes the remorse of two
peasants for a murder they have committed, is a masterpiece
in its vivid representation of terror. It was remodelled as a
tragedy in five acts (Paris, 1899) by its author. <i>Ceux de la
glèbe</i> (1889), dedicated to the &ldquo;children of the soil,&rdquo; was written
in 1885. He turned aside from local subjects for some time to
produce a series of psychological novels, books of art criticism,
&amp;c., of considerable value, but assimilating more closely to
French contemporary literature. The most striking of his
later novels are: <i>L&rsquo;Hystérique</i> (1885); <i>Happe-chair</i> (1886),
often compared with Zola&rsquo;s <i>Germinal</i>; <i>Le Possédé</i> (1890);
<i>La Fin des bourgeois</i> (1892); <i>L&rsquo;Arche, journal d&rsquo;une maman</i>
(1894), a quiet book, quite different from his usual work; <i>La
Faute de Mme Charvet</i> (1895); <i>L&rsquo;Homme en amour</i> (1897); and,
with a return to Flemish subjects, <i>Le Vent dans les moulins</i>
(1901); <i>Petit Homme de Dieu</i> (1902), and <i>Comme va le ruisseau</i>
(1903). In 1888 Lemonnier was prosecuted in Paris for offending
against public morals by a story in <i>Gil Blas</i>, and was condemned
to a fine. In a later prosecution at Brussels he was defended
by Edmond Picard, and acquitted; and he was arraigned for
a third time, at Bruges, for his <i>Homme en amour</i>, but again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
acquitted. He represents his own case in <i>Les Deux consciences</i>
(1902), <i>L&rsquo;Île vierge</i> (1897) was the first of a trilogy to be called
<i>La Légende de la vie</i>, which was to trace, under the fortunes of
the hero, the pilgrimage of man through sorrow and sacrifice to
the conception of the divinity within him. In <i>Adam et Ève</i>
(1899), and <i>Au C&oelig;ur frais de la forêt</i> (1900), he preached the
return to nature as the salvation not only of the individual but
of the community. Among his other more important works
are <i>G. Courbet, et ses &oelig;uvres</i> (1878); <i>L&rsquo;Histoire des Beaux-Arts
en Belgique</i> 1830-1887 (1887); <i>En Allemagne</i> (1888), dealing
especially with the Pinakothek at Munich; <i>La Belgique</i> (1888),
an elaborate descriptive work with many illustrations; <i>La
Vie belge</i> (1905); and <i>Alfred Stevens et son &oelig;uvre</i> (1906).</p>

<p>Lemonnier spent much time in Paris, and was one of the early
contributors to the <i>Mercure de France</i>. He began to write at a
time when Belgian letters lacked style; and with much toil, and
some initial extravagances, he created a medium for the expression
of his ideas. He explained something of the process in a preface
contributed to Gustave Abel&rsquo;s <i>Labeur de la prose</i> (1902). His
prose is magnificent and sonorous, but abounds in neologisms
and strange metaphors.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMONNIER, PIERRE CHARLES<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (1715-1799), French
astronomer, was born on the 23rd of November 1715 in Paris,
where his father was professor of philosophy at the collège
d&rsquo;Harcourt. His first recorded observation was made before
he was sixteen, and the presentation of an elaborate lunar map
procured for him admission to the Academy, on the 21st of
April 1736, at the early age of twenty. He was chosen in the
same year to accompany P. L. Maupertuis and Alexis Clairault
on their geodetical expedition to Lapland. In 1738, shortly
after his return, he explained, in a memoir read before the
Academy, the advantages of J. Flamsteed&rsquo;s mode of determining
right ascensions. His persistent recommendation, in fact,
of English methods and instruments contributed effectively
to the reform of French practical astronomy, and constituted
the most eminent of his services to science. He corresponded
with J. Bradley, was the first to represent the effects of nutation
in the solar tables, and introduced, in 1741, the use of the transit-instrument
at the Paris observatory. He visited England in
1748, and, in company with the earl of Morton and James Short
the optician, continued his journey to Scotland, where he observed
the annular eclipse of July 25. The liberality of Louis XV., in
whose favour he stood high, furnished him with the means of
procuring the best instruments, many of them by English
makers. Amongst the fruits of his industry may be mentioned
a laborious investigation of the disturbances of Jupiter by
Saturn, the results of which were employed and confirmed by
L. Euler in his prize essay of 1748; a series of lunar observations
extending over fifty years; some interesting researches in
terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity, in the latter
of which he detected a regular diurnal period; and the determination
of the places of a great number of stars, including twelve
separate observations of Uranus, between 1765 and its discovery
as a planet. In his lectures at the collège de France he first
publicly expounded the analytical theory of gravitation, and
his timely patronage secured the services of J. J. Lalande for
astronomy. His temper was irritable, and his hasty utterances
exposed him to retorts which he did not readily forgive. Against
Lalande, owing to some trifling pique, he closed his doors &ldquo;during
an entire revolution of the moon&rsquo;s nodes.&rdquo; His career was arrested
by paralysis late in 1791, and a repetition of the stroke terminated
his life. He died at Héril near Bayeux on the 31st of May 1799.
By his marriage with Mademoiselle de Cussy he left three
daughters, one of whom became the wife of J. L. Lagrange.
He was admitted in 1739 to the Royal Society, and was one of
the one hundred and forty-four original members of the Institute.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMOYNE, JEAN BAPTISTE<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (1704-1778), French sculptor,
was the pupil of his father, Jean Louis Lemoyne, and of Robert
le Lorrain. He was a great figure in his day, around whose
modest and kindly personality there waged opposing storms of
denunciation and applause. Although his disregard of the
classic tradition and of the essentials of dignified sculpture,
as well as his lack of firmness and of intellectual grasp of the
larger principles of his art, lay him open to stringent criticism, de
Clarac&rsquo;s charge that he had delivered a mortal blow at sculpture
is altogether exaggerated. Lemoyne&rsquo;s more important works
have for the most part been destroyed or have disappeared.
The equestrian statue of &ldquo;Louis XV.&rdquo; for the military school,
and the composition of &ldquo;Mignard&rsquo;s daughter, Mme Feuquières,
kneeling before her father&rsquo;s bust&rdquo; (which bust was from the
hand of Coysevox) were subjected to the violence by which
Bouchardon&rsquo;s equestrian monument of Louis XIV. (<i>q.v.</i>) was
destroyed. The panels only have been preserved. In his
busts evidence of his riotous and florid imagination to a great
extent disappears, and we have a remarkable series of important
portraits, of which those of women are perhaps the best. Among
Lemoyne&rsquo;s leading achievements in this class are &ldquo;Fontenelle&rdquo;
(at Versailles), &ldquo;Voltaire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Latour&rdquo; (all of 1748), &ldquo;Duc de
la Valière&rdquo; (Versailles), &ldquo;Comte de St Florentin,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Crébillon&rdquo; (Dijon Museum); &ldquo;Mlle Chiron&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mlle
Dangeville,&rdquo; both produced in 1761 and both at the Théâtre
Français in Paris, and &ldquo;Mme de Pompadour,&rdquo; the work of
the same year. Of the Pompadour he also executed a statue
in the costume of a nymph, very delicate and playful in its
air of grace. Lemoyne was perhaps most successful in his
training of pupils, one of the leaders of whom was Falconnet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMPRIÈRE, JOHN<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1765-1824), English classical scholar,
was born in Jersey, and educated at Winchester and Pembroke
College, Oxford. He is chiefly known for his <i>Bibliotheca Classica</i>
or <i>Classical Dictionary</i> (1788), which, edited by various later
scholars, long remained a readable if not very trustworthy
reference book in mythology and classical history. In 1792, after
holding other scholastic posts, he was appointed to the head-mastership
of Abingdon grammar school, and later became the
vicar of that parish. While occupying this living, he published a
<i>Universal Biography of Eminent Persons in all Ages and Countries</i>
(1808). In 1809 he succeeded to the head-mastership of Exeter
free grammar school. On retiring from this, in consequence of
a disagreement with the trustees, he was given the living of Meeth
in Devonshire, which, together with that of Newton Petrock,
he held till his death in London on the 1st of February 1824.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEMUR<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>lemures</i>, &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo;), the name applied
by Linnaeus to certain peculiar Malagasy representatives of the
order <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Primates</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>) which do not come under the designation
of either monkeys or apes, and, with allied animals from the same
island and tropical Asia and Africa, constitute the suborder
<i>Prosimiae</i>, or <i>Lemuroidea</i>, the characteristics of which are given
in the article just mentioned. The typical lemurs include species
like <i>Lemur mongoz</i> and <i>L. catta</i>, but the English name &ldquo;lemur&rdquo;
is often taken to include all the members of the suborder,
although the aberrant forms are often conveniently termed
&ldquo;lemuroids.&rdquo; All the Malagasy lemurs, which agree in the
structure of the internal ear, are now included in the family
<i>Lemuridae</i>, confined to Madagascar and the Comoro Islands,
which comprises the great majority of the group. The other
families are the <i>Nycticebidae</i>, common to tropical Asia and
Africa, and the <i>Tarsiidae</i>, restricted to the Malay countries. In
the more typical <i>Lemuridae</i> there are two pairs of upper incisor
teeth, separated by a gap in the middle line; the premolars may
be either two or three, but the molars, as in the lower jaw, are
always three on each side. In the lower jaw the incisors and
canines are directed straight forwards, and are of small size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
and nearly similar form; the function of the canine being
discharged by the first premolar, which is larger than the
other teeth of the same series. With the exception of the
second toe of the hind-foot, the digits have well-formed,
flattened nails as in the majority of monkeys. In the members
of the typical genus <i>Lemur</i>, as well as in the allied <i>Hapalemur</i>
and <i>Lepidolemur</i>, none of the toes or fingers are connected
by webs, and all have the hind-limbs of moderate length,
and the tail long. The maximum number of teeth is 36, there
being typically two pairs of incisors and three of premolars
in each jaw. In habits some of the species are nocturnal and
others diurnal; but all subsist on a mixed diet, which includes
birds, reptiles, eggs, insects and fruits. Most are arboreal, but
the ring-tailed lemur (<i>L. catta</i>) often dwells among rocks. The
species of the genus <i>Lemur</i> are diurnal, and may be recognized
by the length of the muzzle, and the large tufted ears. In some
cases, as in the black lemur (<i>L. macaco</i>) the two sexes are differently
coloured; but in others, especially the ruffed lemur (<i>L.
varius</i>), there is much individual variation in this respect,
scarcely any two being alike. The gentle lemurs (<i>Hapalemur</i>)
have a rounder head, with smaller ears and a shorter muzzle,
and also a bare patch covered with spines on the fore-arm.
The sportive lemurs (<i>Lepidolemur</i>) are smaller than the typical
species of <i>Lemur</i>, and the adults generally lose their upper
incisors. The head is short and conical, the ears large, round
and mostly bare, and the tail shorter than the body. Like
the gentle lemurs they are nocturnal. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Avahi</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aye-Aye</a></span>,

Wheeling round by the S., it describes a semicircle, then flows
N.N.E. and N.E., being joined by the Kirenga and the Vitim,
both from the right; from 113° E. it flows E.N.E as far as
Yakutsk (62° N., 127° 40&prime; E.), where it enters the lowlands, after
being joined by the Olekma, also from the right. From Yakutsk
it goes N. until joined by its right-hand affluent the Aldan, which
deflects it to the north-west; then, after receiving its most
important left-hand tributary, the Vilyui, it makes its way
nearly due N. to the Nordenskjöld Sea, a division of the Arctic,
disemboguing S.W. of the New Siberian Islands by a delta
10,800 sq. m. in area, and traversed by seven principal branches,
the most important being Bylov, farthest east. The total
length of the river is estimated at 2860 m. The delta arms
sometimes remain blocked with ice the whole year round. At
Yakutsk navigation is generally practicable from the middle of
May to the end of October, and at Kirensk, at the confluence of
the Lena and the Kirenga, from the beginning of May to about
the same time. Between these two towns there is during the
season regular steamboat communication. The area of the river
basin is calculated at 895,500 sq. m. Gold is washed out of the
sands of the Vitim and the Olekma, and tusks of the mammoth
are dug out of the delta.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE NAIN,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> the name of three brothers, <span class="sc">Louis</span>, <span class="sc">Antoine</span>
and <span class="sc">Mathieu</span>, who occupy a peculiar position in the history
of French art. Although they figure amongst the original
members of the French Academy, their works show no trace of
the influences which prevailed when that body was founded.
Their sober execution and choice of colour recall characteristics
of the Spanish school, and when the world of Paris was busy
with mythological allegories, and the &ldquo;heroic deeds&rdquo; of the
king, the three Le Nain devoted themselves chiefly to subjects
of humble life such as &ldquo;Boys Playing Cards,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Forge,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;The Peasants&rsquo; Meal.&rdquo; These three paintings are now in the
Louvre; various others may be found in local collections, and
some fine drawings may be seen in the British Museum; but the
Le Nain signature is rare, and is never accompanied by initials
which might enable us to distinguish the work of the brothers.
Their lives are lost in obscurity; all that can be affirmed is that
they were born at Laon in Picardy towards the close of the 16th
century. About 1629 they went to Paris; in 1648 the three
brothers were received into the Academy, and in the same year
both Antoine and Louis died. Mathieu lived on till August 1677;
he bore the title of chevalier, and painted many portraits. Mary
of Medici and Mazarin were amongst his sitters, but these works
seem to have disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENAU, NIKOLAUS,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> the pseudonym of <span class="sc">Nikolaus Franz
Niembsch von Strehlenau</span> (1802-1850), Austrian poet, who
was born at Csatád near Temesvar in Hungary, on the 15th of
August 1802. His father, a government official, died at Budapest
in 1807, leaving his children to the care of an affectionate, but
jealous and somewhat hysterical, mother, who in 1811 married
again. In 1819 the boy went to the university of Vienna; he
subsequently studied Hungarian law at Pressburg and then spent
the best part of four years in qualifying himself in medicine. But
he was unable to settle down to any profession. He had early
begun to write verses; and the disposition to sentimental
melancholy acquired from his mother, stimulated by love disappointments
and by the prevailing fashion of the romantic
school of poetry, settled into gloom after his mother&rsquo;s death in
1829. Soon afterwards a legacy from his grandmother enabled
him to devote himself wholly to poetry. His first published
poems appeared in 1827, in J. G. Seidl&rsquo;s <i>Aurora</i>. In 1831 he
went to Stuttgart, where he published a volume of <i>Gedichte</i>
(1832) dedicated to the Swabian poet Gustav Schwab. Here he
also made the acquaintance of Uhland, Justinus Kerner, Karl
Mayer<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and others; but his restless spirit longed for change,
and he determined to seek for peace and freedom in America.
In October 1832 he landed at Baltimore and settled on a homestead
in Ohio. But the reality of life in &ldquo;the primeval forest&rdquo;
fell lamentably short of the ideal he had pictured; he disliked
the Americans with their eternal &ldquo;English lisping of dollars&rdquo;
(<i>englisches Talergelispel</i>); and in 1833 he returned to Germany,
where the appreciation of his first volume of poems revived his
spirits. From now on he lived partly in Stuttgart and partly in
Vienna. In 1836 appeared his <i>Faust</i>, in which he laid bare his
own soul to the world; in 1837, <i>Savonarola</i>, an epic in which
freedom from political and intellectual tyranny is insisted upon
as essential to Christianity. In 1838 appeared his <i>Neuere
Gedichte</i>, which prove that <i>Savonarola</i> had been but the result
of a passing exaltation. Of these new poems, some of the finest
were inspired by his hopeless passion for Sophie von Löwenthal,
the wife of a friend, whose acquaintance he had made in 1833
and who &ldquo;understood him as no other.&rdquo; In 1842 appeared
<i>Die Albigenser</i>, and in 1844 he began writing his <i>Don Juan</i>, a
fragment of which was published after his death. Soon afterwards
his never well-balanced mind began to show signs of
aberration, and in October 1844 he was placed under restraint.
He died in the asylum at Oberdöbling near Vienna on the 22nd
of August 1850. Lenau&rsquo;s fame rests mainly upon his shorter
poems; even his epics are essentially lyric in quality. He is
the greatest modern lyric poet of Austria, and the typical representative
in German literature of that pessimistic <i>Weltschmerz</i>
which, beginning with Byron, reached its culmination in the
poetry of Leopardi.</p>

<p>Lenau&rsquo;s <i>Sämtliche Werke</i> were published in 4 vols. by A. Grün
(1855); but there are several more modern editions, as those by

<p><span class="bold">LENBACH, FRANZ VON<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1836-1904), German painter,
was born at Schrobenhausen, in Bavaria, on the 13th of December
1836. His father was a mason, and the boy was intended to
follow his father&rsquo;s trade or be a builder. With this view he was
sent to school at Landsberg, and then to the polytechnic at
Augsburg. But after seeing Hofner, the animal painter, executing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>
some studies, he made various attempts at painting, which
his father&rsquo;s orders interrupted. However, when he had seen
the galleries of Augsburg and Munich, he finally obtained his
father&rsquo;s permission to become an artist, and worked for a short
time in the studio of Gräfle, the painter; after this he devoted
much time to copying. Thus he was already accomplished in
technique when he became the pupil of Piloty, with whom he
set out for Italy in 1858. A few interesting works remain as
the outcome of this first journey&mdash;&ldquo;A Peasant seeking Shelter
from Bad Weather&rdquo; (1855), &ldquo;The Goatherd&rdquo; (1860, in the
Schack Gallery, Munich), and &ldquo;The Arch of Titus&rdquo; (in the
Palfy collection, Budapest). On returning to Munich, he was
at once called to Weimar to take the appointment of professor
at the Academy. But he did not hold it long, having made the
acquaintance of Count Schack, who commissioned a great
number of copies for his collection. Lenbach returned to Italy
the same year, and there copied many famous pictures. He
set out in 1867 for Spain, where he copied not only the famous
pictures by Velasquez in the Prado, but also some landscapes
in the museums of Granada and the Alhambra (1868). In the
previous year he had exhibited at the great exhibition at Paris
several portraits, one of which took a third-class medal. Thereafter
he exhibited frequently both at Munich and at Vienna,
and in 1900 at the Paris exhibition was awarded a Grand Prix
for painting. Lenbach, who died in 1904, painted many of the
most remarkable personages of his time.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENCLOS, NINON DE<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (1615-1705), the daughter of a gentleman
of good position in Touraine, was born in Paris in November
1615. Her long and eventful life divides into two periods,
during the former of which she was the typical Frenchwoman
of the gayest and most licentious society of the 17th century,
during the latter the recognized leader of the fashion in Paris,
and the friend of wits and poets. All that can be pleaded in
defence of her earlier life is that she had been educated by her
father in epicurean and sensual beliefs, and that she retained
throughout the frank demeanour, and disregard of money, which
won from Saint Évremond the remark that she was an <i>honnête
homme</i>. She had a succession of distinguished lovers, among
them being Gaspard de Coligny, the marquis d&rsquo;Éstrées, La
Rochefoucauld, Condé and Saint Évremond. Queen Christina
of Sweden visited her, and Anne of Austria was powerless
against her. After she had continued her career for a preposterous
length of time, she settled down to the social leadership
of Paris. Among her friends she counted Mme de la Sablière,
Mme de la Fayette and Mme de Maintenon. It became the
fashion for young men as well as old to throng round her, and
the best of all introductions for a young man who wished to
make a figure in society was an introduction to Mlle de Lenclos.
Her long friendship with Saint Évremond must be briefly
noticed. They were of the same age, and had been lovers in
their youth, and throughout his long exile the wit seems to have
kept a kind remembrance of her. The few really authentic
letters of Ninon are those addressed to her old friend, and the
letters of both in the last few years of their equally long lives
are exceptionally touching, and unique in the polite compliments
with which they try to keep off old age. If Ninon owes part of
her posthumous fame to Saint Évremond, she owes at least as
much to Voltaire, who was presented to her as a promising boy
poet by the abbé de Chateauneuf. To him she left 2000 francs
to buy books, and his letter on her was the chief authority of
many subsequent biographers. Her personal appearance is,
according to Sainte-Beuve, best described in <i>Clélie</i>, a novel by
Mlle de Scudéry, in which she figures as Clarisse. Her distinguishing
characteristic was neither beauty nor wit, but high
spirits and perfect evenness of temperament.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The letters of Ninon published after her death were, according
to Voltaire, all spurious, and the only authentic ones are those to
Saint Évremond, which can be best studied in Dauxmesnil&rsquo;s edition
of <i>Saint Évremond</i>, and his notice on her. Sainte-Beuve has an
interesting notice of these letters in the <i>Causeries du Lundi</i>, vol. iv.
The <i>Correspondance authentique</i> was edited by E. Colombey in 1886.

<p><span class="bold">LENFANT, JACQUES<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (1661-1728), French Protestant divine,
was born at Bazoche in La Beauce on the 13th of April 1661,
son of Paul Lenfant, Protestant pastor at Bazoche and afterwards
at Châtillon-sur-Loing until the revocation of the edict of
Nantes, when he removed to Cassel. After studying at Saumur
and Geneva, Lenfant completed his theological course at Heidelberg,
where in 1684 he was ordained minister of the French
Protestant church, and appointed chaplain to the dowager
electress palatine. When the French invaded the Palatinate in
1688 Lenfant withdrew to Berlin, as in a recent book he had
vigorously attacked the Jesuits. Here in 1689 he was again
appointed one of the ministers of the French Protestant church;
this office he continued to hold until his death, ultimately
adding to it that of chaplain to the king, with the dignity of
<i>Consistorialrath</i>. He visited Holland and England in 1707,
preached before Queen Anne, and, it is said, was invited to
become one of her chaplains. He was the author of many
works, chiefly on church history. In search of materials he
visited Helmstädt in 1712, and Leipzig in 1715 and 1725. He
died at Berlin on the 7th of August 1728.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>An exhaustive catalogue of his publications, thirty-two in all,
will be found in J. G. de Chauffepié&rsquo;s <i>Dictionnaire</i>. See also E.
and S. Haag&rsquo;s <i>France Protestante</i>. He is now best known by his
<i>Histoire du concile de Constance</i> (Amsterdam, 1714; 2nd ed., 1728;
English trans., 1730). It is of course largely dependent upon the
laborious work of Hermann von der Hardt (1660-1746), but has
literary merits peculiar to itself, and has been praised on all sides
for its fairness. It was followed by <i>Histoire du concile de Pise</i>
(1724), and (posthumously) by <i>Histoire de la guerre des Hussites et
du concile de Basle</i> (Amsterdam, 1731; German translation, Vienna,
1783-1784). Lenfant was one of the chief promoters of the <i>Bibliothèque
Germanique</i>, begun in 1720; and he was associated with
Isaac Beausobre (1659-1738) in the preparation of the new French
translation of the New Testament with original notes, published at
Amsterdam in 1718.</p>

by storm on New Year&rsquo;s day 1813 by the Russians, Lenkoran

by the treaty of Gulistan, along with the khanate of Talysh,
of which it was the capital. Pop. (1867) 15,933, (1897)

is outstripped by Astara, the customs station on the Persian
frontier.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Lenkoran</span> (2117 sq. m.) is a thickly wooded
mountainous region, shut off from the Persian plateau by the
Talysh range (7000-8000 ft. high), and with a narrow marshy
strip along the coast. The climate is exceptionally moist and
warm (annual rainfall 52.79 in; mean temperature in summer
75° F., in winter 40°), and fosters the growth of even Indian
species of vegetation. The iron tree (<i>Parrotia persica</i>), the silk
acacia, <i>Carpinus betulus</i>, <i>Quercus iberica</i>, the box tree and the
walnut flourish freely, as well as the sumach, the pomegranate,
and the <i>Gleditschia caspica</i>. The Bengal tiger is not unfrequently
met with, and wild boars are abundant. Of the 131,361
inhabitants in 1897 the Talyshes (35,000) form the aboriginal
element, belonging to the Iranian family, and speaking an
independently developed language closely related to Persian.
They are of middle height and dark complexion, with generally
straight nose, small round skull, small sharp chin and large full
eyes, which are expressive, however, rather of cunning than
intelligence. They live exclusively on rice. In the northern half
of the district the Tatar element predominates (40,000) and
there are a number of villages occupied by Russian Raskolniks
(Nonconformists). Agriculture, bee-keeping, silkworm-rearing
and fishing are the principal occupations.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENNEP, JACOB VAN<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (1802-1868), Dutch poet and novelist,
was born on the 24th of March 1802 at Amsterdam, where his
father, David Jacob van Lennep (1774-1853), a scholar and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
poet, was professor of eloquence and the classical languages in
the Athenaeum. Lennep took the degree of doctor of laws at
Leiden, and then settled as an advocate in Amsterdam. His
first poetical efforts had been translations from Byron, of whom
he was an ardent admirer, and in 1826 he published a collection
of original <i>Academische Idyllen</i>, which had some success. He
first attained genuine popularity by the <i>Nederlandsche Legenden</i>
(2 vols., 1828) which reproduced, after the manner of Sir Walter
Scott, some of the more stirring incidents in the early history
of his fatherland. His fame was further raised by his patriotic
songs at the time of the Belgian revolt, and by his comedies
<i>Het Dorp aan de Grenzen</i> (1830) and <i>Het Dorp over de Grenzen</i>
(1831), which also had reference to the political events of 1830.
In 1833 he broke new ground with the publication of <i>De Pleegzoon</i>
(<i>The Adopted Son</i>), the first of a series of historical romances
in prose, which have acquired for him in Holland a position
somewhat analogous to that of Sir Walter Scott in Great Britain.
The series included <i>De Roos van Dekama</i> (2 vols., 1836), <i>Onze
Voorouders</i> (5 vols., 1838), <i>De Lotgevallen van Ferdinand Huyck</i>
(2 vols., 1840), <i>Elizabeth Musch</i> (3 vols., 1850), and <i>De Lotgevallen
van Klaasje Zevenster</i> (5 vols., 1865), several of which have been
translated into German and French, and two&mdash;<i>The Rose of
Dekama</i> (1847) and <i>The Adopted Son</i> (New York, 1847)&mdash;into
English. His Dutch history for young people (<i>Voornaamste
Geschiedenissen van Noord-Nederland aan mijne Kindern verhaald</i>,
4 vols., 1845) is attractively written. Apart from the two
comedies already mentioned, Lennep was an indefatigable
journalist and literary critic, the author of numerous dramatic
pieces, and of an excellent edition of Vondel&rsquo;s works. For some
years Lennep held a judicial appointment, and from 1853 to
1856 he was a member of the second chamber, in which he voted
with the conservative party. He died at Oosterbeek near
Arnheim on the 25th of August 1868.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENNEP,<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province,
18 m. E. of Düsseldorf, and 9 m. S. of Barmen by rail, at a height
of 1000 ft. above the level of the sea. Pop. (1905) 10,323. It lies
in the heart of one of the busiest industrial districts in Germany,
and carries on important manufactures of the finer kinds of cloth,
wool, yarn and felt, and also of iron and steel goods. It has an
Evangelical and a Protestant church, a modern school and a
well-equipped hospital. Lennep, which was the residence of the
counts of Berg from 1226 to 1300, owes the foundation of its
prosperity to an influx of Cologne weavers during the 14th
century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENNOX,<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> a name given to a large district in Dumbartonshire
and Stirlingshire, which was erected into an earldom in the latter
half of the 12th century. It embraced the ancient sheriffdom
of Dumbarton and nineteen parishes with the whole of the lands
round Loch Lomond, formerly Loch Leven, and the river of
that name which glides into the estuary of the Clyde at the
ancient castle of Dumbarton.</p>

<p>On this river Leven, at Balloch, was the seat of Alwin, first
earl of Lennox. It is probable that he was of Celtic descent, but
the records are silent as to his part in history; that he was earl
at all is only proved from the charters of his son, another Alwin,
and he died some time before 1217. The second Alwin was
father of ten sons, one of whom founded the clan Macfarlane,
famous in the annals of the district, while another was ancestor of
Walter of Farlane, who married the heiress of the 6th earl of
Lennox. Maldouen, the 3rd earl, eldest of the sons of Alwin the
younger, is an historical personage; he was a witness to the
treaty between Alexander II., king of Scotland, and his brother-in-law
the English king Henry III., at Newcastle in 1237,
concerning the much disputed northern counties of England.
His grandson, Malcolm, successor to the title, swore fealty to
Edward I. in 1296; it was apparently his son, another Malcolm,
the 5th earl, who was summoned by Edward to parliament
and entrusted with the important post of guarding the fords of
the river Forth. But the 5th earl soon after gave his services
to the party of Bruce, the cause of that family having been
embraced by his father as early as 1292. As a result the English
king bestowed the earldom on Sir John Menteith, who was
holding it in 1307 while the real earl was with King Robert
Bruce in his wanderings in the Lennox country. For his services
he was rewarded with a renewal of the earldom and the keeping
of Dumbarton Castle; he fell fighting for his country at Halidon
Hill in 1333. His son Donald, the 6th earl, an adherent of
King David II., left a daughter, Margaret, countess of Lennox,
who was married to her kinsman the above-mentioned Walter
of Farlane, nearest heir male of the Lennox family.</p>

<p>In 1392, on the marriage of their grand-daughter Isabella,
eldest daughter of Duncan, 8th earl, with Sir Murdoch Stewart,
afterwards duke of Albany, the earldom was resigned into the
hands of the king, who re-granted it to Earl Duncan, with
remainder to the heirs male of his body, with remainder to
Murdoch and Isabella and the heirs of their bodies begotten
between them, with eventual remainder to Earl Duncan&rsquo;s nearest
and lawful heirs. In 1424, when Murdoch, then duke of Albany,
succeeded in ransoming the poet king James I. from his long
English captivity, the aged Earl Duncan went with the Scottish
party to Durham. The next year, however, he suffered the fate
of Albany, being executed perhaps for no other reason than that
he was his father-in-law. The earldom was not forfeited, and the
widowed duchess of Albany, now also countess of Lennox, lived
secure in her island castle of Inchmurrin on Loch Lomond until
her death. Of her four sons, none of whom left legitimate issue,
the eldest died in 1421, the two next suffered their father&rsquo;s
fate at Stirling, while the youngest had to flee for his life to
Ireland. Her daughter Isobel appears to have been the wife of
Sir Walter Buchanan of that ilk.</p>

<p>It was from Elizabeth, sister of the countess, that the next
holders of the title descended. She was married to Sir John
Stewart of Darnley (distinguished in the military history of
France as seigneur d&rsquo;Aubigny), whose immediate ancestor was
brother of James, 5th high steward of Scotland. Their grandson,
another Sir John Stewart, created a lord of parliament as Lord
Darnley, was served heir to his great-grandfather Duncan, earl
of Lennox, in 1473, and was designated as earl of Lennox in
a charter under the great seal in the same year. Thereafter
followed disputes with John of Haldane, whose wife&rsquo;s great-grandmother
had been another of the three daughters of Duncan, 8th
earl of Lennox, and in her right he contested the succession.
Lord Darnley, however, appears to have silenced all opposition
and for the last seven years of his life maintained his right to
the earldom undisputed. Three of his younger sons were greatly
distinguished in the French service, one being captain of Scotsmen-at-arms,
another <i>premier homme d&rsquo;armes</i>, and a third <i>maréchal de
France</i>. Their elder brother Matthew, 2nd earl of this line,
fell on Flodden Field, leaving by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of
James, earl of Arran, and niece of James III., a son and successor
John, who became one of the guardians of James V. and was
murdered in 1526. His son Matthew, the 4th earl, played a great
part in the intrigues of his time, and by his marriage with Margaret
Douglas allied himself to the royal house of England as well as
strengthening the ties which bound his family to that of Scotland;
because Margaret was the daughter and heir of the 6th earl of
Angus by his wife, Margaret Tudor, sister of King Henry VIII.
and widow of King James IV. Though his estates were forfeited
in 1545, Earl Matthew in 1564 not only had them restored but
had the satisfaction of getting his eldest son Henry married
to Mary, queen of Scots. The murder of Lord Darnley, now
created earl of Rosse, lord of Ardmanoch and duke of Albany,
took place in February 1567, and in July his only son James, by
Mary&rsquo;s abdication, became king of Scotland. The old earl of
Lennox, now grandfather of his sovereign, obtained the regency
in 1570, but in the next year was killed in the attack made on
the parliament at Stirling, being the third earl in succession to
meet with a violent death.</p>

<p>The title was now merged in the crown in the person of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
James VI. the next heir, but was soon after granted to the king&rsquo;s
uncle Charles, who died in 1576, leaving an only child, the
unfortunate Lady Arabella Stewart.</p>

<p>Two years later the title was granted to Robert Stewart, the
king&rsquo;s grand-uncle, second son of John, the 3rd earl, but he in
1580 exchanged it for that of earl of March. On the same day
the earldom of Lennox was given to Esme Stewart, first cousin
of the king and grandson of the 3rd earl, he being son of John
Stewart (adopted heir of the maréchal d&rsquo;Aubigny) and his
French wife, Anne de la Queulle. In the following year Esme was
created duke of Lennox, earl of Darnley, Lord Aubigny, Tarboulton
and Dalkeith, and other favours were heaped upon him,
but the earl of Ruthven sent him back to France where he died
soon after. His elder son, Ludovic, was thereupon summoned
to Scotland by James, who invested him with all his father&rsquo;s
honours and estates, and after his accession to the English throne
created him Lord Settrington and earl of Richmond (1613), and
earl of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and duke of Richmond (1623),
all these titles being in the peerage of England. After holding
many appointments the 2nd duke died without issue in 1624,
being succeeded in his Scottish titles by his brother Esme, who
had already been created earl of March and Lord Clifton of
Leighton Bromswold in the peerage of England (1619) and was
seigneur d&rsquo;Aubigny in France. Of his sons, Henry succeeded
to Aubigny and died young at Venice; Ludovic, seigneur
d&rsquo;Aubigny, entered the Roman Catholic Church and received a
cardinal&rsquo;s hat just before his death; while the three other younger
sons, George, seigneur d&rsquo;Aubigny, John and Bernard, were all
distinguished as royalists in the Civil war. Each met a soldier&rsquo;s
death, George at Edgehill, John at Alresford and Bernard at
Rowton Heath. James, the eldest son and 4th duke of Lennox,
was created duke of Richmond in 1641, being like his brother a
devoted adherent of Charles I.</p>

<p>With the death of his little son Esme, the 5th duke, in 1660,
the titles, including that of Richmond, passed to his first cousin
Charles, who had already been created Lord Stuart of Newbury
and earl of Lichfield, being likewise now seigneur d&rsquo;Aubigny.
Disliked by Charles II., principally because of his marriage with
&ldquo;la belle Stuart&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the noblest romance and example of a
brave lady that ever I read in my life,&rdquo; writes Pepys&mdash;he was
sent into exile as ambassador to Denmark, where he was drowned
in 1672. His wife had had the Lennox estates granted to her
for life, but his only sister Katharine, wife of Henry O&rsquo;Brien,
heir apparent of the 7th earl of Thomond, was served heir to
him. Her only daughter, the countess of Clarendon, was
mother of Theodosia Hyde, ancestress of the present earls of
Darnley.</p>

<p>The Lennox dukedom, being to heirs male, now devolved
upon Charles II., who bestowed it with the titles of earl of Darnley
and Lord Tarbolton upon one of his bastards, Charles Lennox,
son of the celebrated duchess of Portsmouth, he having previously
been created duke of Richmond, earl of March and Lord Settrington
in the peerage of England. The ancient lands of the Lennox
title were also granted to him, but these he sold to the duke of
Montrose.</p>

<p>His son Charles, who inherited his grandmother&rsquo;s French
dukedom of Aubigny, was a soldier of distinction, as were the
3rd and 4th dukes. The wife of the last, Lady Charlotte Gordon,
as heir of her brother brought the ancient estates of her family
to the Lennoxes; the additional name of Gordon being taken
by the 5th duke of Richmond and of Lennox on the death of his
uncle, the 5th duke of Gordon. In the next generation further
honours were granted to the family in the person of the 6th
duke, who was rewarded for his great public services with the
titles of duke of Gordon and earl of Kinrara in the peerage
of the United Kingdom (1876).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENNOX, CHARLOTTE<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (1720-1804), British writer, daughter
of Colonel James Ramsay, lieutenant-governor of New York,
was born in 1720. She went to London in 1735, and, being left
unprovided for at her father&rsquo;s death, she began to earn her
living by writing. She made some unsuccessful appearances
on the stage and married in 1748. Samuel Johnson had an
exaggerated admiration for her. &ldquo;Three such women,&rdquo; he
said, speaking of Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More and Fanny
Burney, &ldquo;are not to be found; I know not where to find a
fourth, except Mrs Lennox, who is superior to them all.&rdquo; Her
chief works are: <i>The Female Quixote; or the Adventures of
Arabella</i> (1752), a novel; <i>Shakespear illustrated; or the novels
and histories on which the plays ... are founded</i> (1753-1754),
in which she argued that Shakespeare had spoiled the stories
he borrowed for his plots by interpolating unnecessary intrigues
and incidents; <i>The Life of Harriot Stuart</i> (1751), a novel; and
<i>The Sister</i>, a comedy produced at Covent Garden (18th February
1769). This last was withdrawn after the first night, after a
stormy reception, due, said Goldsmith, to the fact that its author
had abused Shakespeare.</p>

of Archibald Douglas, 6th earl of Angus, and Margaret Tudor,
daughter of Henry VII. of England and widow of James IV. of
Scotland, was born at Harbottle Castle, Northumberland, on
the 8th of October 1515. On account of her nearness to the
English crown, Lady Margaret Douglas was brought up chiefly
at the English court in close association with the Princess Mary,
who remained her fast friend throughout life. She was high
in Henry VIII.&rsquo;s favour, but was twice disgraced; first for an
attachment to Lord Thomas Howard, who died in the Tower
in 1537, and again in 1541 for a similar affair with Sir Charles
Howard, brother of Queen Catherine Howard. In 1544 she
married a Scottish exile, Matthew Stewart, 4th earl of Lennox
(1516-1571), who was regent of Scotland in 1570-1571. During
Mary&rsquo;s reign the countess of Lennox had rooms in Westminster
Palace; but on Elizabeth&rsquo;s accession she removed to Yorkshire,
where her home at Temple Newsam became a centre for Catholic
intrigue. By a series of successful man&oelig;uvres she married
her son Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, to Mary, queen of Scots.
In 1566 she was sent to the Tower, but after the murder of
Darnley in 1567 she was released. She was at first loud in her
denunciations of Mary, but was eventually reconciled with her
daughter-in-law. In 1574 she again aroused Elizabeth&rsquo;s anger
by the marriage of her son Charles, earl of Lennox, with Elizabeth
Cavendish, daughter of the earl of Shrewsbury. She was sent
to the Tower with Lady Shrewsbury, and was only pardoned
after her son&rsquo;s death in 1577. Her diplomacy largely contributed
to the future succession of her grandson James to the English
throne. She died on the 7th of March 1578.</p>

In 1888-1889 he was engaged by Sir Augustus Harris to play
the Baroness in the <i>Babes in the Wood</i>, and from that time he
was a principal figure in the Drury Lane pantomimes. He was
the wittiest and most popular comedian of his day, and delighted
London music-hall audiences by his shop-walker, stores-proprietor,
waiter, doctor, beef-eater, bathing attendant, &ldquo;Mrs Kelly,&rdquo;
and other impersonations. In 1900 he engaged to give his
entire services to the Pavilion Music Hall, where he received
£100 per week. In November 1901 he was summoned to Sandringham
to do a &ldquo;turn&rdquo; before the king, and was proud from
that time to call himself the &ldquo;king&rsquo;s jester.&rdquo; Dan Leno&rsquo;s

<p><span class="bold">LENORMANT, FRANÇOIS<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1837-1883), French Assyriologist
and archaeologist, was born in Paris on the 17th of January
1837. His father, Charles Lenormant, distinguished as an
archaeologist, numismatist and Egyptologist, was anxious
that his son should follow in his steps. He made him begin
Greek at the age of six, and the child responded so well to this
precocious scheme of instruction, that when he was only fourteen
an essay of his, on the Greek tablets found at Memphis, appeared
in the <i>Revue archéologique</i>. In 1856 he won the numismatic
prize of the Académie des Inscriptions with an essay entitled
<i>Classification des monnaies des Lagides</i>. In 1862 he became
sub-librarian of the Institute. In 1859 he accompanied his
father on a journey of exploration to Greece, during which
Charles Lenormant succumbed to fever at Athens (24th
November). Lenormant returned to Greece three times during
the next six years, and gave up all the time he could spare
from his official work to archaeological research. These peaceful
labours were rudely interrupted by the war of 1870, when
Lenormant served with the army and was wounded in the siege
of Paris. In 1874 he was appointed professor of archaeology at
the National Library, and in the following year he collaborated
with Baron de Witte in founding the <i>Gazette archéologique</i>.
As early as 1867 he had turned his attention to Assyrian studies;
he was among the first to recognize in the cuneiform inscriptions
the existence of a non-Semitic language, now known as Accadian.
Lenormant&rsquo;s knowledge was of encyclopaedic extent, ranging
over an immense number of subjects, and at the same time
thorough, though somewhat lacking perhaps in the strict
accuracy of the modern school. Most of his varied studies
were directed towards tracing the origins of the two great
civilizations of the ancient world, which were to be sought
in Mesopotamia and on the shores of the Mediterranean. He
had a perfect passion for exploration. Besides his early expeditions
to Greece, he visited the south of Italy three times with
this object, and it was while exploring in Calabria that he met
with an accident which ended fatally in Paris on the 9th of
December 1883, after a long illness. The amount and variety
of Lenormant&rsquo;s work is truly amazing when it is remembered
that he died at the early age of forty-six. Probably the best
known of his books are <i>Les Origines de l&rsquo;histoire d&rsquo;après la Bible</i>,
and his ancient history of the East and account of Chaldean
magic. For breadth of view, combined with extraordinary
subtlety of intuition, he was probably unrivalled.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENOX,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> a township of Berkshire county, Massachusetts,
U.S.A. Pop. (1900) 2942, (1905) 3058; (1910) 3060. Area,
19.2 sq. m. The principal village, also named Lenox (or Lenox-on-the-Heights),
lies about 2 m. W. of the Housatonic river,
at an altitude of about 1000 ft., and about it are high hills&mdash;Yokun
Seat (2080 ft.), South Mountain (1200 ft.), Bald Head
(1583 ft.), and Rattlesnake Hill (1540 ft.). New Lenox and
Lenoxdale are other villages in the township. Lenox is a fashionable
summer and autumn resort, much frequented by wealthy
people from Washington, Newport and New York. There are
innumerable lovely walks and drives in the surrounding region,
which contains some of the most beautiful country of the Berkshires&mdash;hills,
lakes, charming intervales and woods. As early
as 1835 Lenox began to attract summer residents. In the next
decade began the creation of large estates, although the great
holdings of the present day, and the villas scattered over the
hills, are comparatively recent features. The height of the
season is in the autumn, when there are horse-shows, golf, tennis,
hunts and other outdoor amusements. The Lenox library
(1855) contained about 20,000 volumes in 1908. Lenox was
settled about 1750, was included in Richmond township in 1765,
and became an independent township in 1767. The names were
those of Sir Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond and of
Lennox (1735-1806), one of the staunch friends of the American
colonies during the War of Independence. Lenox was the county-seat
from 1787 to 1868. It has literary associations with
Catherine M. Sedgwick (1789-1867), who passed here the second
half of her life; with Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose brief residence
here (1850-1851) was marked by the production of the <i>House
of the Seven Gables</i> and the <i>Wonder Book</i>; with Fanny Kemble,
a summer resident from 1836-1853; and with Henry Ward
Beecher (see his <i>Star Papers</i>). Elizabeth (Mrs Charles) Sedgwick,
the sister-in-law of Catherine Sedgwick, maintained here from
1828 to 1864 a school for girls, in which Harriet Hosmer, the
sculptor, and Maria S. Cummins (1827-1866), the novelist,
were educated; and in Lenox academy (1803), a famous classical
school (now a public high school) were educated W. L. Yancey,
A. H. Stephens, Mark Hopkins and David Davis (1815-1886),
a circuit judge of Illinois from 1848 to 1862, a justice (1862-1877)
of the United States Supreme Court, a Republican member
of the United States Senate from Illinois in 1877-1883, and
president of the Senate from the 31st of October 1881, when
he succeeded Chester A. Arthur, until the 3rd of March 1883.
There is a statue commemorating General John Paterson (1744-1808)
a soldier from Lenox in the War of Independence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENS<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>lens</i>, lentil, on account of the similarity
of the form of a lens to that of a lentil seed), in optics, an
instrument which refracts the luminous rays proceeding from
an object in such a manner as to produce an image of the object.
It may be regarded as having four principal functions: (1) to
produce an image larger than the object, as in the magnifying
glass, microscope, &amp;c.; (2) to produce an image smaller than
the object, as in the ordinary photographic camera; (3) to convert
rays proceeding from a point or other luminous source
into a definite pencil, as in lighthouse lenses, the engraver&rsquo;s
globe, &amp;c.; (4) to collect luminous and heating rays into a
smaller area, as in the burning glass. A lens made up of two
or more lenses cemented together or very close to each other
is termed &ldquo;composite&rdquo; or &ldquo;compound&rdquo;; several lenses
arranged in succession at a distance from each other form a
&ldquo;system of lenses,&rdquo; and if the axes be collinear a &ldquo;centred
system.&rdquo; This article is concerned with the general theory
of lenses, and more particularly with spherical lenses. For
a special part of the theory of lenses see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aberration</a></span>; the
instruments in which the lenses occur are treated under their
own headings.</p>

<p>The most important type of lens is the spherical lens, which
is a piece of transparent material bounded by two spherical
surfaces, the boundary at the edge being usually cylindrical or
conical. The line joining the centres, C<span class="su">1</span>, C<span class="su">2</span> (fig. 1), of the
bounding surfaces is termed the <i>axis</i>; the points S<span class="su">1</span>, S<span class="su">2</span>, at
which the axis intersects the surfaces, are termed the &ldquo;vertices&rdquo;
of the lens; and the distance between the vertices is termed
the &ldquo;thickness.&rdquo; If the edge be everywhere equidistant from
the vertex, the lens is &ldquo;centred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although light is really a wave motion in the aether, it is only
necessary, in the investigation of the optical properties of systems
of lenses, to trace the rectilinear path of the waves, <i>i.e.</i> the
direction of the normal to the wave front, and this can be done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
by purely geometrical methods. It will be assumed that light,
so long as it traverses the same medium, always travels in
a straight line; and in following out the geometrical theory
it will always be assumed that the light travels from left to
right; accordingly all distances measured in this direction are
positive, while those measured in the opposite direction are
negative.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Theory of Optical Representation.</i>&mdash;If a pencil of rays, <i>i.e.</i> the
totality of the rays proceeding from a luminous point, falls on a
lens or lens system, a section of the pencil, determined by the
dimensions of the system, will be transmitted. The emergent rays
will have directions differing from those of the incident rays, the
alteration, however, being such that the transmitted rays are convergent
in the &ldquo;image-point,&rdquo; just as the incident rays diverge
from the &ldquo;object-point.&rdquo; With each incident ray is associated an
emergent ray; such pairs are termed &ldquo;conjugate ray pairs.&rdquo;
Similarly we define an object-point and its image-point as &ldquo;conjugate
points&rdquo;; all object-points lie in the &ldquo;object-space,&rdquo; and all
image-points lie in the &ldquo;image-space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laws of optical representations were first deduced in their
most general form by E. Abbe, who assumed (1) that an optical
representation always exists, and (2) that to every point in the
object-space there corresponds a point in the image-space, these
points being mutually convertible by straight rays; in other words,
with each object-point is associated one, and only one, image-point,
and if the object-point be placed at the image-point, the conjugate
point is the original object-point. Such a transformation is termed
a &ldquo;collineation,&rdquo; since it transforms points into points and straight
lines into straight lines. Prior to Abbe, however, James Clerk
Maxwell published, in 1856, a geometrical theory of optical representation,
but his methods were unknown to Abbe and to his pupils
until O. Eppenstein drew attention to them. Although Maxwell&rsquo;s
theory is not so general as Abbe&rsquo;s, it is used here since its methods
permit a simple and convenient deduction of the laws.</p>

<p>Maxwell assumed that two object-planes perpendicular to the
axis are represented sharply and similarly in two image-planes
also perpendicular to the axis (by &ldquo;sharply&rdquo; is
meant that the assumed ideal instrument unites
all the rays proceeding from an object-point in
one of the two planes in its image-point, the rays
being generally transmitted by the system). The
symmetry of the axis being premised, it is sufficient
to deduce laws for a plane containing the axis. In
fig. 2 let O<span class="su">1</span>, O<span class="su">2</span> be the two points in which the
perpendicular object-planes meet the axis; and
since the axis corresponds to itself, the two conjugate
points O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, are at the intersections of
the two image-planes with the axis. We denote
the four planes by the letters O<span class="su">1</span>, O<span class="su">2</span>, and O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>.
If two points A, C be taken in the plane O<span class="su">1</span>, their
images are A&prime;, C&prime; in the plane O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, and since the
planes are represented similarly, we have O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>A&prime;:O<span class="su">1</span>A = O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>C&prime;<span class="su">1</span>:O<span class="su">1</span>C = &beta;<span class="su">1</span>
(say), in which &beta;<span class="su">1</span> is easily seen to be the <i>linear magnification</i> of
the plane-pair O<span class="su">1</span>, O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>. Similarly, if two points B, D be taken in
the plane O<span class="su">2</span> and their images B&prime;, D&prime; in the plane O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, we have
O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>B&prime;:O<span class="su">2</span>B = O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>D&prime;:O<span class="su">2</span>D = &beta;<span class="su">2</span> (say), &beta;<span class="su">2</span> being the linear magnification
of the plane-pair O<span class="su">2</span>, O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>. The joins of A and B and of C and D
intersect in a point P, and the joins of the conjugate points similarly
determine the point P&prime;.</p>

<p>If P&prime; is the only possible image-point of the object-point P, then
the conjugate of every ray passing through P must pass through
P&prime;. To prove this, take a third line through P intersecting the
planes O<span class="su">1</span>, O<span class="su">2</span> in the points E, F, and by means of the magnifications
&beta;<span class="su">1</span>, &beta;<span class="su">2</span> determine the conjugate points E&prime;, F&prime; in the planes O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>.
Since the planes O<span class="su">1</span>, O<span class="su">2</span> are parallel, then AC/AE = BD/BF; and
since these planes are represented similarly in O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, then A&prime;C&prime;/A&prime;E&prime;
= B&prime;D&prime;/B&prime;F&prime;. This proportion is only possible when the straight
line E&prime;F&prime; contains the point P&prime;. Since P was any point whatever,
it follows that every point of the object-space is represented in
one and only one point in the image-space.</p>

<p>Take a second object-point P<span class="su">1</span>, vertically under P and defined by
the two rays CD<span class="su">1</span>, and EF<span class="su">1</span>, the conjugate point P&prime;<span class="su">1</span> will be determined
by the intersection of the conjugate rays C&prime;D&prime;<span class="su">1</span> and E&prime;F&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, the
points D&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, F&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, being readily found from the magnifications &beta;<span class="su">1</span>, &beta;<span class="su">2</span>.
Since PP<span class="su">1</span> is parallel to CE and also to DF, then DF = D<span class="su">1</span>F<span class="su">1</span>. Since
the plane O<span class="su">2</span> is similarly represented in O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, D&prime;F&prime; = D&prime;<span class="su">1</span>F&prime;<span class="su">1</span>; this is
impossible unless P&prime;P&prime;<span class="su">1</span> be parallel to C&prime;E&prime;. Therefore every perpendicular
object-plane is represented by a perpendicular image-plane.</p>

<p>Let O be the intersection of the line PP<span class="su">1</span> with the axis, and let O&prime;
be its conjugate; then it may be shown that a fixed magnification
&beta;<span class="su">3</span> exists for the planes O and O&prime;. For PP<span class="su">1</span>/FF<span class="su">1</span> = OO<span class="su">1</span>/O<span class="su">1</span>O<span class="su">2</span>,
P&prime;P&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/F&prime;F&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = O&prime;O&prime;/O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, and F&prime;F&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = &beta;<span class="su">2</span>FF<span class="su">1</span>. Eliminating FF<span class="su">1</span> and
F&prime;F&prime;<span class="su">1</span> between these ratios, we have P&prime;P&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/PP<span class="su">1</span>&beta;<span class="su">2</span> = O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>·O<span class="su">1</span>O<span class="su">2</span>/OO<span class="su">1</span>.
O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, or &beta;<span class="su">3</span> = &beta;<span class="su">2</span>·O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>·O<span class="su">1</span>O<span class="su">2</span>/OO<span class="su">1</span>·O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, <i>i.e.</i> &beta;<span class="su">3</span> = &beta;<span class="su">2</span> × a product of
the axial distances.</p>

<p>The determination of the image-point of a given object-point is
facilitated by means of the so-called &ldquo;cardinal points&rdquo; of the
optical system. To determine the image-point O&prime;<span class="su">1</span> (fig. 3) corresponding
to the object-point O<span class="su">1</span>, we begin by choosing from the ray
pencil proceeding from O<span class="su">1</span>, the ray parallel with the axis, <i>i.e.</i> intersecting
the axis at infinity. Since the axis is its own conjugate, the
parallel ray through O<span class="su">1</span> must intersect the axis after refraction
(say at F&prime;). Then F&prime; is the image-point of an object-point situated
at infinity on the axis, and is termed the &ldquo;second principal focus&rdquo;
(German <i>der bildseitige Brennpunkt</i>, the image-side focus). Similarly
if O&prime;<span class="su">4</span> be on the parallel through O<span class="su">1</span> but in the image-space, then the
conjugate ray must intersect the axis at a point (say F), which is
conjugate with the point at infinity on the axis in the image-space.
This point is termed the &ldquo;first principal focus&rdquo; (German <i>der objektseitige
Brennpunkt</i>, the object-side focus).</p>

<p>Let H<span class="su">1</span>, H&prime;<span class="su">1</span> be the intersections of the focal rays through F and F&prime;
with the line O<span class="su">1</span>O&prime;<span class="su">4</span>. These two points are in the position of object
and image, since they are each determined by two pairs of conjugate
rays (O<span class="su">1</span>H<span class="su">1</span> being conjugate with H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>F&prime;, and O&prime;<span class="su">4</span>H&prime;<span class="su">1</span> with H<span class="su">1</span>F).
It has already been shown that object-planes perpendicular to the
axis are represented by image-planes also perpendicular to the axis.
Two vertical planes through H<span class="su">1</span> and H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, are related as object- and
image-planes; and if these planes intersect the axis in two points
H and H&prime;, these points are named the &ldquo;principal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gauss
points&rdquo; of the system, H being the &ldquo;object-side&rdquo; and H&prime; the
&ldquo;image-side principal point.&rdquo; The vertical planes containing H
and H&prime; are the &ldquo;principal planes.&rdquo; It is obvious that conjugate
points in these planes are equidistant from the axis; in other
words, the magnification &beta; of the pair of planes is unity. An additional
characteristic of the principal planes is that the object and
image are direct and not inverted. The distances between F and H,
and between F&prime; and H&prime; are termed the focal lengths; the former
may be called the &ldquo;object-side focal length&rdquo; and the latter the
&ldquo;image-side focal length.&rdquo; The two focal points and the two
principal points constitute the so-called four cardinal points of the
system, and with their aid the image of any object can be readily
determined.</p>

<p><i>Equations relating to the Focal Points.</i>&mdash;We know that the ray
proceeding from the object point O<span class="su">1</span>, parallel to the axis and intersecting
the principal plane H in H<span class="su">1</span>, passes through H&prime;<span class="su">1</span> and F&prime;.
Choose from the pencil a second ray which contains F and intersects
the principal plane H in H<span class="su">2</span>; then the conjugate ray must
contain points corresponding to F and H<span class="su">2</span>. The conjugate of F is
the point at infinity on the axis, <i>i.e.</i> on the ray parallel to the axis.
The image of H<span class="su">2</span> must be in the plane H&prime; at the same distance from,
and on the same side of, the axis, as in H&prime;<span class="su">2</span>. The straight line
passing through H&prime;<span class="su">2</span> parallel to the axis intersects the ray H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>F&prime;
in the point O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, which must be the image of O<span class="su">1</span>. If O be the foot of
the perpendicular from O<span class="su">1</span> to the axis, then OO<span class="su">1</span> is represented by
the line O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span> also perpendicular to the axis.</p>

<p>This construction is not applicable if the object or image be
infinitely distant. For example, if the object OO<span class="su">1</span> be at infinity
(O being assumed to be on the axis for the sake of simplicity), so
that the object appears under a constant angle w, we know that
the second principal focus is conjugate with the infinitely distant
axis-point. If the object is at infinity in a plane perpendicular to
the axis, the image must be in the perpendicular plane through the
focal point F&prime; (fig. 4).</p>

<p>The size y&prime; of the image is readily deduced. Of the parallel rays
from the object subtending the angle w, there is one which passes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
through the first principal focus F, and intersects the principal
plane H in H<span class="su">1</span>. Its conjugate ray passes through H&prime; parallel to, and
at the same distance from the axis, and intersects the image-side
focal plane in O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>; this point is the image of O<span class="su">1</span>, and y&prime; is its magnitude.
From the figure we have tan w = HH<span class="su">1</span>/FH = y&prime;/f, or f = y&prime;/tan w;
this equation was used by Gauss to define the focal length.</p>

<p>Referring to fig. 3, we have from the similarity of the triangles
OO<span class="su">1</span>F and HH<span class="su">2</span>F, HH<span class="su">2</span>/OO<span class="su">1</span> = FH/FO, or O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/OO<span class="su">1</span> = FH/FO.
Let y be the magnitude of the object OO<span class="su">1</span>, y&prime; that of the image
O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, x the focal distance FO of the object, and f the object-side
focal distance FH; then the above equation may be written
y&prime;/y = f/x. From the
similar triangles
H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>H&prime;F&prime; and O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>O&prime;F&prime;,
we obtain O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/OO<span class="su">1</span>
= F&prime;O&prime;/F&prime;H&prime;. Let x&prime;
be the focal distance
of the image F&prime;O&prime;,
and f&prime; the image-side
focal length
F&prime;H&prime;; then y&prime;/y =
x&prime;/f&prime;. The ratio of
the size of the image
to the size of the
object is termed the <i>lateral magnification</i>. Denoting this by &beta;, we
have</p>

<p class="center">&beta; = y&prime;/y = f/x = x&prime;/f&prime;,</p>
<div class="author">(1)</div>

<p class="noind">and also</p>

<p class="center">xx&prime; = ff&prime;.</p>
<div class="author">(2)</div>

<p class="noind">By differentiating equation (2) we obtain</p>

<p class="center">dx&prime;= &minus;(ff&prime;/x<span class="sp">2</span>) dx or dx&prime;/dx = &minus;ff&prime;/x<span class="sp">2</span>.</p>
<div class="author">(3)</div>

<p class="noind">The ratio of the displacement of the image dx&prime; to the displacement
of the object dx is the axial magnification, and is denoted by &alpha;.
Equation (3) gives important information on the displacement of
the image when the object is moved. Since f and f&prime; always have
contrary signs (as is proved below), the product &minus;ff&prime; is invariably
positive, and since x<span class="sp">2</span> is positive for all values of x, it follows that
dx and dx&prime; have the same sign, <i>i.e.</i> the object and image always
move in the same direction, either both in the direction of the
light, or both in the opposite direction. This is shown in fig. 3 by
the object O<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">2</span> and the image O&prime;<span class="su">3</span>O&prime;<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p>If two conjugate rays be drawn from two conjugate points on
the axis, making angles u and u&prime; with the axis, as for example the
rays OH<span class="su">1</span>, O&prime;H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, in fig. 3, u is termed the &ldquo;angular aperture for
the object,&rdquo; and u&prime; the &ldquo;angular aperture for the image.&rdquo; The ratio
of the tangents of these angles is termed the &ldquo;convergence&rdquo; and is
denoted by &gamma;, thus &gamma; = tan u&prime;/tan u. Now tan u&prime;= H&prime;H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/O&prime;H&prime;
= H&prime;H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/(O&prime;F&prime; + F&prime;H&prime;) = H&prime;H&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/(F&prime;H&prime; &minus; F&prime;O&prime;). Also tan u = HH<span class="su">1</span>/OH
= HH<span class="su">1</span>/(OF + FH) = HH<span class="su">1</span>/(FH &minus; FO). Consequently &gamma; = (FH &minus; FO)/(F&prime;H&prime; &minus; F&prime;O&prime;),
or, in our previous notation, &gamma; = (f &minus; x)/(f&prime; &minus; x&prime;).</p>

<p>From equation (1) f/x = x&prime;/f&prime;, we obtain by subtracting unity from
both sides (f &minus; x)/x = (x&prime; &minus; f&prime;)/f&prime;, and consequently</p>

<p>From equations (1), (3) and (4), it is seen that a simple relation
exists between the lateral magnification, the axial magnification
and the convergence, viz. &alpha;&gamma; = &beta;.</p>

<p>In addition to the four cardinal points F, H, F&prime;, H&prime;, J. B. Listing,
&ldquo;Beiträge aus physiologischen Optik,&rdquo; <i>Göttinger Studien</i> (1845)
introduced the so-called &ldquo;nodal points&rdquo; (<i>Knotenpunkte</i>) of the
system, which are
the two conjugate
points from which
the object and
image appear under
the same angle. In
fig. 5 let K be the
nodal point from
which the object y
appears under the
same angle as the image y&prime; from the other nodal point K&prime;. Then
OO<span class="su">1</span>/KO = O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/K&prime;O&prime;, or OO<span class="su">1</span>/(KF + FO) = O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/(K&prime;F&prime;+ F&prime;O&prime;), or
OO<span class="su">1</span>/(FO &minus; FK) = O&prime;O&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/(F&prime;O&prime;&minus; F&prime;K&prime;). Calling the focal distances FK
and F&prime;K&prime;, X and X&prime;, we have y/(x &minus; X) = y&prime;/(x&prime;&minus; X&prime;), and since
y&prime;/y = &beta;, it follows that 1/(x &minus; X) = &beta;/(x&prime;&minus; X&prime;). Replace x&prime; and X&prime; by
the values given in equation (2), and we obtain</p>

<p class="noind">Since &beta; = f/x = x&prime;/f&prime;, we have f&prime; = &minus;X, f = &minus;X&prime;.</p>

<p class="noind">These equations show that to determine the nodal points, it is only
necessary to measure the focal distance of the second principal focus
from the first principal focus, and vice versa. In the special case
when the initial and final medium is the same, as for example, a
lens in air, we have f = &minus;f&prime;, and the nodal points coincide with the
principal points of the system; we then speak of the &ldquo;nodal point
property of the principal points,&rdquo; meaning that the object and
corresponding image subtend the same angle at the principal points.</p>

<p><i>Equations Relating to the Principal Points.</i>&mdash;It is sometimes
desirable to determine the distances of an object and its image, not
from the focal points, but from the principal points. Let A (see
fig. 3) be the principal point distance of the object and A&prime; that of
the image, we then have</p>

<p class="center">A = HO = HF + FO = FO &minus; FH = x &minus; f,<br />
 A&prime; = H&prime;O&prime; = H&prime;F&prime; + F&prime;O&prime; = F&prime;O&prime; &minus; F&prime;H&prime; = x&prime; &minus; f&prime;,</p>

<p class="noind">whence</p>

<p class="center">x = A + f and x&prime; = A&prime; + f&prime;.</p>

<p class="noind">Using xx&prime; = ff&prime;, we have (A + f)(A&prime; + f&prime;) = ff&prime;, which leads to AA&prime; +
Af&prime; + A&prime;f = O, or</p>

<p class="noind">To express the linear magnification in terms of the principal point
distances, we start with equation (4) (f &minus; x)/(f&prime; &minus; x&prime;) = &minus;x/f&prime;. From
this we obtain A/A&prime; = -x/f&prime;, or x = &minus;f&prime;A/A&prime;; and by using equation
(1) we have &beta; = &minus;fA&prime;/f&prime;A.</p>

<p>In the special case of f = &minus;f&prime;, this becomes &beta; = A&prime;/A = y&prime;/y, from
which it follows that the ratio of the dimensions of the object and
image is equal to the ratio of the distances of the object and image
from the principal points.</p>

<p>The convergence can be determined in terms of A and A&prime; by
substituting x = &minus;f&prime;A/A&prime; in equation (4), when we obtain &gamma; = A/A&prime;.</p>

<p><i>Compound Systems.</i>&mdash;In discussing the laws relating to compound
systems, we assume that the cardinal points of the component
systems are known, and also that the combinations are centred,
<i>i.e.</i> that the axes of the component lenses coincide. If some object
be represented by two systems arranged one behind the other, we
can regard the systems as co-operating in the formation of the final
image.</p>

<p>Let such a system be represented in fig. 6. The two single systems
are denoted by the suffixes 1 and 2; for example, F<span class="su">1</span> is the first
principal focus of the first, and F&prime;<span class="su">2</span> the second principal focus of the
second system. A ray parallel to the axis at a distance y passes
through the second principal focus F&prime;<span class="su">1</span> of the first system, intersecting
the axis at an angle w&prime;<span class="su">1</span>. The point F&prime;<span class="su">1</span> will be represented
in the second system by the point F&prime;, which is therefore conjugate
to the point at infinity for the entire system, <i>i.e.</i> it is the second
principal focus of the compound system. The representation of
F&prime;<span class="su">1</span> in F&prime; by the second system leads to the relations F<span class="su">2</span>F&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = x<span class="su">2</span>,
and F&prime;<span class="su">2</span>F&prime; = x&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, whence x<span class="su">2</span>x&prime;<span class="su">2</span> = f<span class="su">2</span>f&prime;<span class="su">2</span>. Denoting the distance between
the adjacent focal planes F&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, F<span class="su">2</span> by &Delta;, we have &Delta; = F&prime;<span class="su">1</span>F<span class="su">2</span> = &minus;F<span class="su">2</span>F&prime;<span class="su">1</span>,
so that x&prime;<span class="su">2</span> = -f<span class="su">2</span>f&prime;<span class="su">2</span>/&Delta;. A similar ray parallel to the axis at a distance
y proceeding from the image-side will intersect the axis at the focal
point F<span class="su">2</span>; and by finding the image of this point in the first system,
we determine the first principal focus of the compound system.
Equation (2) gives x<span class="su">1</span>x&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = f<span class="su">1</span>f&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, and since x&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = F&prime;<span class="su">1</span>F<span class="su">2</span> = &Delta;, we have
x<span class="su">1</span> = f<span class="su">1</span>f&prime;<span class="su">1</span>/&Delta; as the distance of the first principal focus F of the
compound system from the first principal focus F<span class="su">1</span> of the first
system.</p>

<p>To determine the focal lengths f and f&prime; of the compound system
and the principal points H and H&prime;, we employ the equations defining
the focal lengths, viz. f = y&prime;/tan w, and f&prime; = y/tan w&prime;. From the

<p>So far we have assumed that all the rays proceeding from an object-point

through the ideal system. The question now arises <span class="correction" title="amended from so">as</span> to how far
this assumption is justified for spherical lenses. To investigate this
it is simplest to trace the path of a ray through one spherical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>424</span>
refracting surface. Let such a surface divide media of refractive
indices n and n&prime;, the former being to the left. The point where the
axis intersects the surface is the vertex S (fig. 7). Denote the
distance of the axial object-point O from S by s; the distance from
O to the point of incidence P by p; the radius of the spherical
surface by r; and the distance OC by c, C being the centre of the
sphere. Let u be the angle made by the ray with the axis, and i
the angle of incidence, <i>i.e.</i> the angle between the ray and the normal
to the sphere at the point of incidence. The corresponding quantities
in the image-space are denoted by the same letters with a dash.
From the triangle O&prime;PC we have sin u = (r/c) sin i, and from the
triangle O&prime;PC we have sin u&prime; = (r/c&prime;) sin i&prime;. By Snell&rsquo;s law we have
n&prime;/n = sin i/sin i&prime;, and also &phi; = u&prime; + i&prime;. Consequently c&prime; and the

<p>To determine whether all the rays proceeding from O are refracted

<p class="noind">This relation shows that in a very small central aperture in which
the equation p = s holds, all rays proceeding from an object-point
are exactly united in an image-point, and therefore the equations
previously deduced are valid for this aperture. K. F. Gauss
derived the equations for thin pencils in his <i>Dioptrische Untersuchungen</i>
(1840) by very elegant methods. More recently the laws
relating to systems with finite aperture have been approximately
realized, as for example, in well-corrected photographic objectives.</p>

<p><i>Position of the Cardinal Points of a Lens.</i>&mdash;Taking the case of a
single spherical refracting surface, and limiting ourselves to the
small central aperture, it is seen that the second principal focus F&prime;
is obtained when s is infinitely great. Consequently s&prime; = -f&prime;; the
difference of sign is obvious, since s&prime; is measured from S, while f&prime;
is measured from F&prime;. The focal lengths are directly deducible from
equation (7):&mdash;</p>

<p>By joining this simple refracting system with a similar one, so
that the second spherical surface limits the medium of refractive
index n&prime;, we derive the spherical lens. Generally the two spherical
surfaces enclose a glass lens, and are bounded on the outside by air
of refractive index 1.</p>

<p>The deduction of the cardinal points of a spherical glass lens in
air from the relations already proved is readily effected if we regard
the lens as a combination of two systems each having one refracting
surface, the light passing in the first system from air to glass, and
in the second from glass to air. If we know the refractive index of
the glass n, the radii r<span class="su">1</span>, r<span class="su">2</span> of the spherical surfaces, and the distances
of the two lens-vertices (or the thickness of the lens d) we can determine
all the properties of the lens. A biconvex lens is shown in
fig. 8. Let F<span class="su">1</span> be the first principal focus of the first system of
radius r<span class="su">1</span>, and F<span class="su">1</span>&prime; the second principal focus; and let S<span class="su">1</span> be its
vertex. Denote the distance F<span class="su">1</span> S<span class="su">1</span> (the first principal focal length)

<p>The distance between the two principal planes (the interstitium)

<p>We have now derived all the properties of the lens in terms of its
elements, viz. the refractive index, the radii of the surfaces, and the
thickness.</p>

<p><i>Forms of Lenses.</i>&mdash;By varying the signs and relative magnitude
of the radii, lenses may be divided into two groups according to
their action, and into four groups according to their form.</p>

<p>According to their action, lenses are either collecting, convergent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span>
and condensing, or divergent and dispersing; the term positive is
sometimes applied to the former, and the term negative to the
latter. Convergent lenses transform a parallel pencil into a converging
one, and increase the convergence, and diminish the divergence
of any pencil. Divergent lenses, on the other hand, transform
a parallel pencil into a diverging one, and diminish the convergence,
and increase the divergence of any pencil. In convergent lenses the
first principal focal distance is positive and the second principal
focal distance negative; in divergent lenses the converse holds.</p>

<p>The four forms of lenses are interpretable by means of equation
(10).</p>

<p>(1) If r<span class="su">1</span> be positive and r<span class="su">2</span> negative. This type is called biconvex
(fig. 9, 1). The first principal focus is in front of the lens, and the
second principal focus behind the lens, and the two principal points
are inside the lens. The order of the cardinal points is therefore
FS<span class="su">1</span>HH&prime;S<span class="su">2</span>F&prime;. The lens is convergent so long as the thickness is
less than n(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>)/(n &minus; 1). The special case when one of the radii
is infinite, in other words, when one of the bounding surfaces is plane
is shown in fig. 9, 2. Such a collective lens is termed <i>plano-convex</i>.
As d increases, F and H move to the right and F&prime; and H&prime; to the
left. If d = n(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>)/(n &minus; 1), the focal length is infinite, <i>i.e.</i> the
lens is telescopic. If the thickness be greater than n(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>)/(n &minus; 1),
the lens is dispersive, and the order of the cardinal points is
HFS<span class="su">1</span>S<span class="su">2</span>F&prime;H&prime;.</p>

<p>(2) If r<span class="su">1</span> is negative and r<span class="su">2</span> positive. This type is called <i>biconcave</i>
(fig. 9, 4). Such lenses are dispersive for all thicknesses. If d
increases, the radii remaining constant, the focal lengths diminish.
It is seen from the equations giving the distances of the cardinal
points from the vertices that the first principal focus F is always
behind S<span class="su">1</span>, and the second principal focus F&prime; always in front of S<span class="su">2</span>,
and that the principal points are within the lens, H&prime; always following
H. If one of the radii becomes infinite, the lens is <i>plano-concave</i>
(fig. 9, 5).</p>

<p>(3) If the radii are both positive. These lenses are called <i>convexo-concave</i>.
Two cases occur according as r<span class="su">2</span> &gt; r<span class="su">1</span>, or &lt; r<span class="su">1</span>. (<i>a</i>) If
r<span class="su">2</span> &gt; r<span class="su">1</span>, we obtain the <i>mensicus</i> (fig. 9, 3). Such lenses are always
collective; and the order of the cardinal points is FHH&prime;F&prime;. Since
s<span class="su">F</span> and s<span class="su">H</span> are always negative, the object-side cardinal points are
always in front of the lens. H&prime; can take up different positions.
Since s<span class="su">H&prime;</span> = &minus;dr<span class="su">2</span>/R = &minus;dr<span class="su">2</span>/{n (r<span class="su">2</span> &minus; r<span class="su">1</span>) + d(n &minus; 1)}, s<span class="su">H&prime;</span> is greater or less
than d, <i>i.e.</i> H&prime; is either in front of or inside the lens, according as
d &lt; or &gt; {r<span class="su">2</span> &minus; n(r<span class="su">2</span> &minus; r<span class="su">1</span>)}/(n &minus; 1). (<i>b</i>) If r<span class="su">2</span> &lt; r<span class="su">1</span> the lens is dispersive so
long as d &lt; n(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>)/(n &minus; 1). H is always behind S<span class="su">1</span> and H&prime; behind S<span class="su">2</span>,
since s<span class="su">H</span> and s<span class="su">H&prime;</span> are always positive. The focus F is always behind
S<span class="su">1</span> and F&prime; in front of S<span class="su">2</span>. If the thickness be small, the order of the
cardinal points is F&prime;HH&prime;F; a dispersive lens of this type is shown
in fig. 9, 6. As the thickness increases, H, H&prime; and F move to the
right, F more rapidly than H, and H more rapidly than H&prime;; F&prime;,
on the other hand, moves to the left. As with biconvex lenses, a
telescopic lens, having all the cardinal points at infinity, results
when d = n(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>)/(n &minus; 1). If d &gt; n(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>)/(n &minus; 1), f is positive and
the lens is collective. The cardinal points are in the same order as
in the mensicus, viz. FHH&prime;F&prime;; and the relation of the principal
points to the vertices is also the same as in the mensicus.</p>

<p>(4) If r<span class="su">1</span> and r<span class="su">2</span> are both negative. This case is reduced to (3)
above, by assuming a change in the direction of the light, or, in
other words, by interchanging the object- and image-spaces.</p>

<p>The six forms shown in fig. 9 are all used in optical constructions.
It may be stated fairly generally that lenses which are thicker at
the middle are collective, while those which are thinnest at the
middle are dispersive.</p>

<p><i>Different Positions of Object and Image.</i>&mdash;The principal points are
always near the surfaces limiting the lens, and consequently the lens
divides the direct
pencil containing
the axis into two
parts. The object
can be either in
front of or behind
the lens as in fig. 10.
If the object point
be in front of the
lens, and if it be realized by rays passing from it, it is called <i>real</i>.
If, on the other hand, the object be behind the lens, it is called
<i>virtual</i>; it does not actually exist, and can only be realized as an
image.</p>

<p>When we speak of &ldquo;object-points,&rdquo; it is always understood that
the rays from the object traverse the first surface of the lens before
meeting the second. In the same way, images may be either real
or virtual. If the image be behind the second surface, it is <i>real</i>,
and can be intercepted on a screen. If, however, it be in front of
the lens, it is visible
to an eye placed
behind the lens,
although the rays do
not actually intersect,
but only appear
to do so, but the
image cannot be intercepted
on a screen
behind the lens.
Such an image is said to be <i>virtual</i>. These relations are shown in
fig. 11.</p>

<p>By referring to the equations given above, it is seen that a thin
convergent lens produces both real and virtual images of real objects,
but only a real image of a virtual object, whilst a divergent lens
produces a virtual image of a real object and both real and virtual
images of a virtual object. The construction of a real image of a
real object by a convergent lens is shown in fig. 3; and that of a
virtual image of a real object by a divergent lens in fig. 12.</p>

<p><i>The optical centre of a lens</i> is a point such that, for any ray which
passes through it, the incident and emergent rays are parallel. The
idea of the optical centre was originally due to J. Harris (<i>Treatise
on Optics</i>, 1775); it is not properly a cardinal point, although it has
several interesting properties. In fig. 13, let C<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span> and C<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span> be two
parallel radii of a biconvex lens. Join P<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">2</span> and let O<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span> and O<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span>
be incident and emergent rays which have P<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">2</span> for the path through
the lens. Then if M be the intersection of P<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">2</span> with the axis, we
have angle C<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span>M = angle C<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span>M; these two angles are&mdash;for a ray
travelling in the direction O<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">2</span>&mdash;the angles of emergence and
of incidence respectively. From the similar triangles C<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span>M and
C<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span>M we have</p>

<p class="center">C<span class="su">1</span>M : C<span class="su">2</span>M = C<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">1</span> : C<span class="su">2</span>P<span class="su">2</span> = r<span class="su">1</span> : r<span class="su">2</span>.</p>
<div class="author">(11)</div>

<p class="noind">Such rays as P<span class="su">1</span>P<span class="su">2</span> therefore divide the distance C<span class="su">1</span>C<span class="su">2</span> in the ratio of
the radii, <i>i.e.</i> at the fixed point M, the optical centre. Calling
S<span class="su">1</span>M = s<span class="su">1</span>, S<span class="su">2</span>M = s<span class="su">2</span>, then C<span class="su">1</span>S<span class="su">1</span> = C<span class="su">1</span>M + MS<span class="su">1</span> = C<span class="su">1</span>M &minus; S<span class="su">1</span>M, <i>i.e.</i> since C<span class="su">1</span>S<span class="su">1</span>
= r<span class="su">1</span>, C<span class="su">1</span>M = r<span class="su">1</span> + s<span class="su">1</span>, and similarly C<span class="su">2</span>M = r<span class="su">2</span> + s<span class="su">2</span>. Also S<span class="su">1</span>S<span class="su">2</span> = S<span class="su">1</span>M + MS<span class="su">2</span>
= S<span class="su">1</span>M &minus; S<span class="su">2</span>M, <i>i.e.</i> d = s<span class="su">1</span> &minus; s<span class="su">2</span>. Then by using equation (11) we have
s<span class="su">1</span> = r<span class="su">1</span>d/(r &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>) and s<span class="su">2</span> = r<span class="su">2</span>d/(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>), and hence s<span class="su">1</span>/s<span class="su">2</span> = r<span class="su">1</span>/r<span class="su">2</span>. The
vertex distances of the optical centre are therefore in the ratio of
the radii.</p>

<p>The values of s<span class="su">1</span> and s<span class="su">2</span> show that the optical centre of a biconvex
or biconcave lens is in the interior of the lens, that in a plano-convex
or plano-concave lens it is at the vertex of the curved surface, and
in a concavo-convex lens outside the lens.</p>

<p><i>The Wave-theory Derivation of the Focal Length.</i>&mdash;The formulae
above have been derived by means of geometrical rays. We here
give an account of Lord Rayleigh&rsquo;s wave-theory derivation of the
focal length of a convex lens in terms of the aperture, thickness
and refractive index (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 1879 (5) 8, p. 480; 1885, 20,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
p. 354); the argument is based on the principle that the optical
distance from object to image is constant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking the case of a convex lens of glass, let us suppose that
parallel rays DA, EC, GB (fig. 14) fall upon the lens ACB, and are
collected by it to a focus at F. The points D, E, G, equally distant
from ACB, lie upon a front of the wave before it impinges upon the
lens. The focus is a point at which the different parts of the wave
arrive at the same time, and that such a point can exist depends
upon the fact that the propagation is slower in glass than in air.
The ray ECF is retarded
from having
to pass through the
thickness (<i>d</i>) of
glass by the amount
(n &minus; 1)d. The ray
DAF, which traverses
only the extreme
edge of the
lens, is retarded
merely on account
of the crookedness
of its path, and the
amount of the retardation is measured by AF &minus; CF. If F is a focus
these retardations must be equal, or AF &minus; CF = (n &minus; 1)d. Now if y
be the semi-aperture AC of the lens, and f be the focal length CF,
AF &minus; CF = &radic;(f<span class="sp">2</span> + y<span class="sp">2</span>) &minus; f = ½y<span class="sp">2</span>/f approximately, whence</p>

<p class="center">f = ½y<span class="sp">2</span> / (n &minus; 1)d.</p>
<div class="author">(12)</div>

<p class="noind">In the case of plate-glass (n &minus; 1) = ½ (nearly), and then the rule (12)
may be thus stated: <i>the semi-aperture is a mean proportional between
the focal length and the thickness</i>. The form (12) is in general the
more significant, as well as the more practically useful, but we may,
of course, express the thickness in terms of the curvatures and semi-aperture
by means of d = ½y<span class="sp">2</span> (r<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">&minus;1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">&minus;1</span>). In the preceding statement
it has been supposed for simplicity that the lens comes to a sharp
edge. If this be not the case we must take as the thickness of the
lens the difference of the thicknesses at the centre and at the circumference.
In this form the statement is applicable to concave lenses,
and we see that the focal length is positive when the lens is thickest
at the centre, but negative when the lens is thickest at the edge.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Regulation of the Rays.</i></p>

<p>The geometrical theory of optical instruments can be conveniently
divided into four parts: (1) The relations of the
positions and sizes of objects and their images (see above);
(2) the different aberrations from an ideal image (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aberration</a></span>);
(3) the intensity of radiation in the object- and image-spaces,
in other words, the alteration of brightness caused by
physical or geometrical influences; and (4) the regulation
of the rays (<i>Strahlenbegrenzung</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The regulation of rays will here be treated only in systems free
from aberration. E. Abbe first gave a connected theory; and M.
von Rohr has done a great deal towards the elaboration. The
Gauss cardinal points make it simple to construct the image of
a given object. No account is taken of the size of the system, or
whether the rays used for the construction really assist in the
reproduction of the image or not. The diverging cones of rays
coming from the object-points can only take a certain small part
in the production of the image in consequence of the apertures of
the lenses, or of diaphragms. It often happens that the rays used
for the construction of the image do not pass through the system;
the image being formed by quite different rays. If we take a
luminous point of the object lying on the axis of the system then an
eye introduced at the image-point sees in the instrument several
concentric rings, which are either the fittings of the lenses or their
images, or the real diaphragms or their images. The innermost
and smallest ring is completely lighted, and forms the origin of the
cone of rays entering the image-space. Abbe called it the <i>exit pupil</i>.
Similarly there is a corresponding smallest ring in the object-space
which limits the entering cone of rays. This is called the
<i>entrance pupil</i>. The real diaphragm acting as a limit at any part
of the system is called the <i>aperture-diaphragm</i>. These diaphragms
remain for all practical purposes the same for all points lying on
the axis. It sometimes happens that one and the same diaphragm
fulfils the functions of the entrance pupil and the aperture-diaphragm
or the exit pupil and the aperture-diaphragm.</p>

<p>Fig. 15 shows the general but simplified case of the different
diaphragms which are of importance for the regulation of the
rays. S<span class="su">1</span>, S<span class="su">2</span> are two centred systems. A&prime; is a real diaphragm
lying between them. B<span class="su">1</span> and B&prime;<span class="su">2</span> are the fittings of the systems.
Then S<span class="su">1</span> produces the virtual image A of the diaphragm A&prime; and the
image B<span class="su">2</span> of the fitting B&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, whilst the system S<span class="su">2</span> makes the virtual
image A&Prime; of the diaphragm A&prime; and the virtual image B&prime;<span class="su">1</span> of the fitting
B<span class="su">1</span>. The object-point O is reproduced really through the whole
system in the point O&prime;. From the object-point O three diaphragms
can be seen in the object-space, viz. the fitting B<span class="su">1</span>, the image of the
fitting B<span class="su">2</span> and the image A of the diaphragm A&prime; formed by the
system S<span class="su">1</span>. The cone of rays nearest to B<span class="su">2</span> is not received to its
total extent by the fitting B<span class="su">1</span>, and the cone which has entered
through B<span class="su">1</span> is again diminished in its further course, when passing
through the diaphragm A&prime;, so that the cone of rays really used
for producing the image is limited by A, the diaphragm which seen
from O appears to be the smallest. A is therefore the entrance
pupil. The real diaphragm A&prime; which limits the rays in the
centre of the system is the aperture diaphragm. Similarly three
diaphragms lying in the image-space are to be seen from the
image-point O&prime;&mdash;namely B&prime;, A&Prime;, and B&prime;<span class="su">2</span>. A&Prime; limits the rays in the
image-space, and is therefore the exit pupil. As A is conjugate to
the diaphragm A&prime; in the system S<span class="su">1</span>, and A&Prime; to the same diaphragm
A&prime; in the system S<span class="su">2</span>, the entrance pupil A is conjugate to the exit
pupil A&Prime; throughout the instrument. This relation between entrance
and exit pupils is general.</p>

<p>The apices of the cones of rays producing the image of points near
the axis thus lie in the object-points, and their common base is the
entrance pupil. The axis of such a cone, which connects the object
point with the centre of the entrance pupil, is called the <i>principal ray</i>.
Similarly, the principal rays in the image-space join the centre of
the exit pupil with the image-points. The centres of the entrance and
exit pupils are thus the intersections of the principal rays.</p>

<p>For points lying farther from the axis, the entrance pupil no longer
alone limits the rays, the other diaphragms taking part. In fig. 16
only one diaphragm L is
present besides the entrance
pupil A, and the object-space
is divided to a certain
extent into four parts. The
section M contains all points
rendered by a system with
a complete aperture; N contains
all points rendered by
a system with a gradually
diminishing aperture; but
this diminution does not
attain the principal ray
passing through the centre
C. In the section O are
those points rendered by a
system with an aperture
which gradually decreases to
zero. No rays pass from the
points of the section P
through the system and no
image can arise from them.
The second diaphragm L therefore limits the three-dimensional
object-space containing the points which can be rendered by the
optical system. From C through this diaphragm L this three-dimensional
object-space can be seen as through a window. L is
called by M von Rohr the <i>entrance luke</i>. If several diaphragms can
be seen from C, then the entrance <i>luke</i> is the diaphragm which seen
from C appears the smallest. In the sections N and O the entrance
<i>luke</i> also takes part in limiting the cones of rays. This restriction
is known as the &ldquo;vignetting&rdquo;
action of the entrance <i>luke</i>. The
base of the cone of rays for the
points of this section of the
object-space is no longer a circle
but a two-cornered curve which
arises from the object-point by
the projection of the entrance
<i>luke</i> on the entrance pupil.
Fig. 17<i>a</i> shows the base of such
a cone of rays. It often happens
that besides the entrance
<i>luke</i>, another diaphragm acts
in a vignetting manner, then
the operating aperture of the cone of rays is a curve made up
of circular arcs formed out of the entrance pupil and the two
projections of the two acting diaphragms (fig. 17<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>If the entrance pupil is narrow, then the section NO, in which the
vignetting is increasing, is diminished, and there is really only one
division of the section M which can be reproduced, and of the section
P which cannot be reproduced. The angle w + w = 2w, comprising
the section which can be reproduced, is called the angle of the field of
view on the object-side. The field of view 2w retains its importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
if the entrance pupil is increased. It then comprises all points
reached by principal rays. The same relations apply to the image-space,
in which there is an exit <i>luke</i>, which, seen from the middle
of the exit pupil, appears under the smallest angle. It is the image
of the entrance <i>luke</i> produced by the whole system. The image-side
field of view 2w&prime; is the angle comprised by the principal rays
reaching the edge of the exit <i>luke</i>.</p>

<p>Most optical instruments are used to observe object-reliefs (three-dimensional
objects), and generally an image-relief (a three-dimensional
image) is conjugate to this object-relief. It is sometimes
required, however, to represent by means of an optical instrument
the object-relief on a plane or on a ground-glass as in the photographic
camera. For simplicity we shall assume the intercepting plane
as perpendicular to the axis and shall call it, after von Rohr, the
&ldquo;ground glass plane.&rdquo; All points of the image not lying in this
plane produce circular spots (corresponding to the form of the
pupils) on it, which are called &ldquo;circles of confusion.&rdquo; The ground-glass
plane (fig. 18) is conjugate to the object-plane E in the
object-space, perpendicular to the axis, and called the &ldquo;plane
focused for.&rdquo; All points lying in this plane are reproduced exactly
on the ground-glass plane as the points OO. The circle of confusion
Z on the plane focused for corresponds to the circle of confusion
Z&prime; on the ground-glass plane. The figure formed on the plane
focused for by the cones of rays from all of the object-points of the
total object-space directed to the entrance pupil, was called &ldquo;object-side
representation&rdquo; (<i>imago</i>) by M von Rohr. This representation
is a central projection. If, for instance, the entrance pupil is
imagined so small that only the principal rays pass through, then
they project directly, and the intersections of the principal rays
represent the projections of the points of the object lying off
the plane focused for. The centre of the projection or the perspective
centre is the middle point of the entrance pupil C. If the
entrance pupil is opened, in place of points, circles of confusion appear,
whose size depends upon the size of the entrance pupil and the
position of the object-points and the plane focused for. The intersection
of the principal ray is the centre of the circle of confusion.
The clearness of the representation on the plane focused for is of
course diminished by the circles of confusion. This central projection
does not at all depend upon the instrument, but is entirely
geometrical, arising when the position and the size of the entrance
pupil, and the position of the plane focused for have been fixed.
The instrument then produces an image on the ground-glass plane
of this perspective representation on the plane focused for, and on
account of the exact likeness which this image has to the object-side
representation it is called the &ldquo;representation copy.&rdquo; By
moving it round an angle of 180°, this representation can be
brought into a perspective position to the objects, so that all
rays coming from the middle of the entrance pupil and aiming
at the object-points, would always meet the corresponding image-points.
This representation is accessible to the observer in different
ways in different instruments. If the observer desires a perfectly
correct perspective impression of the object-relief the distance of
the pivot of the eye from the representation copy must be equal
to the <i>n</i>th part of the distance of the plane focused for from the
entrance pupil, if the instrument has produced a nth diminution of
the object-side representation. The pivot of the eye must coincide
with the centre of the perspective, because all images are observed
in direct vision. It is known that the pivot of the eye is the
point of intersection of all the directions in which one can look.
Thus all these points represented by circles of confusion which are
less than the angular sharpness of vision appear clear to the
eye; the space containing all these object-points, which appear
clear to the eye, is called the <i>depth</i>. The depth of definition,
therefore, is not a special property of the instrument, but depends
on the size of the entrance pupil, the position of the plane focused
for and on the conditions under which the representation can be
observed.</p>

<p>If the distance of the representation from the pivot of the eye be
altered from the correct distance already mentioned, the angles of
vision under which various objects appear are changed; perspective
errors arise, causing an incorrect idea to be given of the depth. A
simple case is shown in fig. 19. A cube is the object, and if it is
observed as in fig. 19<i>a</i> with the representation copy at the
correct distance, a correct idea of a cube will be obtained. If, as
in figs. 19<i>b</i> and 19<i>c</i>, the distance is too great, there can be
two results. If it is known that the farthest section is just
as high as the nearer one then the cube appears exceptionally
deepened, like a long parallelepipedon. But if it is known to be as
deep as it is high then the eye will see it low at the back and
high at the front. The reverse occurs when the distance of
observation is too short, the body then appears either too flat, or
the nearer sections seem too low in relation to those farther off.
These perspective errors can be seen in any telescope. In the
telescope ocular the representation copy has to be observed under
too large an angle or at too short a distance: all objects therefore
appear flattened, or the more distant objects appear too large in
comparison with those nearer at hand.</p>

<p>From the above the importance of experience will be inferred.
But it is not only necessary that the objects themselves be known
to the observer but also that they are presented to his eye in
the customary manner. This depends upon the way in which the
principal rays pass through the system&mdash;in other words, upon the
special kind of &ldquo;transmission&rdquo; of the principal rays. In ordinary
vision the pivot of the eye is the centre of the perspective representation
which arises on the very distant plane standing perpendicular
to the mean direction of sight. In this kind of central projection
all objects lying in front of the plane focused for are diminished
when projected on this plane, and those lying behind it are magnified.
(The distances are always given in the direction of light.) Thus the
objects near to the eye appear large and those farther from it appear
small. This perspective has been called by M von Rohr<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> &ldquo;entocentric
transmission&rdquo; (fig. 20). If the entrance pupil of the instrument
lies at infinity, then all the principal rays are parallel and the
projections of all objects on the plane focused for are exactly as
large as the objects themselves. After E. Abbe, this course of rays
is called &ldquo;telecentric transmission&rdquo; (fig. 21). The exit pupil then lies
in the image-side focus of the
system. If the perspective
centre lies in front of the plane
focused for, then the objects
lying in front of this plane are
magnified and those behind it
are diminished. This is just the
reverse of perspective representation
in ordinary sight, so that the relations of size and the
arrangements for space must be quite incorrectly indicated (fig. 22);
this representation is called by M von Rohr a &ldquo;hypercentric
transmission.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENT<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>lencten</i>, &ldquo;spring,&rdquo; M. Eng. <i>lenten</i>, <i>lente</i>, <i>lent</i>; cf.
Dut. <i>lente</i>, Ger. <i>Lenz</i>, &ldquo;spring,&rdquo; O. H. Ger. <i>lenzin</i>, <i>lengizin</i>, <i>lenzo</i>,
probably from the same root as &ldquo;long&rdquo; and referring to &ldquo;the
lengthening days&rdquo;), in the Christian Church, the period of
fasting preparatory to the festival of Easter. As this fast
falls in the early part of the year, it became confused with the
season, and gradually the word Lent, which originally meant
spring, was confined to this use. The Latin name for the fast,
<i>Quadragesima</i> (whence Ital. <i>quaresima</i>, Span. <i>cuaresma</i> and Fr.
<i>carême</i>), and its Gr. equivalent <span class="grk" title="tessarakostê">&#964;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#942;</span> (now superseded
by the term <span class="grk" title="hê nêsteia">&#7969; &#957;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span> &ldquo;the fast&rdquo;), are derived from the Sunday
which was the fortieth day before Easter, as <i>Quinquagesima</i>
and <i>Sexagesima</i> are the fiftieth and sixtieth, Quadragesima
being until the 7th century the <i>caput jejunii</i> or first day of
the fast.</p>

<p>The length of this fast and the rigour with which it has been
observed have varied greatly at different times and in different
countries (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fasting</a></span>). In the time of Irenaeus the fast before
Easter was very short, but very severe; thus some ate nothing
for forty hours between the afternoon of Good Friday and the
morning of Easter. This was the only authoritatively prescribed
fast known to Tertullian (<i>De jejunio</i>, 2, 13, 14; <i>De oratione</i>, 18).
In Alexandria about the middle of the 3rd century it was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
customary to fast during Holy Week; and earlier still the
Montanists boasted that they observed a two weeks&rsquo; fast instead
of one. Of the Lenten fast or Quadragesima, the first mention
is in the fifth canon of the council of Nicaea (325), and from this
time it is frequently referred to, but chiefly as a season of preparation
for baptism, of absolution of penitents or of retreat and
recollection. In this season fasting played a part, but it was
not universally nor rigorously enforced. At Rome, for instance,
the whole period of fasting was but three weeks, according to the
historian Socrates (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> v. 22), these three weeks, in Mgr.
Duchesne&rsquo;s opinion, being not continuous but, following the
primitive Roman custom, broken by intervals. Gradually,
however, the fast as observed in East and West became more
rigorously defined. In the East, where after the example of
the Church of Antioch the Quadragesima fast had been kept
distinct from that of Holy Week, the whole fast came to last
for seven weeks, both Saturdays and Sundays (except Holy
Saturday) being, however, excluded. In Rome and Alexandria,
and even in Jerusalem, Holy Week was included in Lent and the
whole fast lasted but six weeks, Saturdays, however, not being
exempt. Both at Rome and Constantinople, therefore, the actual
fast was but thirty-six days. Some Churches still continued the
three weeks&rsquo; fast, but by the middle of the 5th century most of
these divergences had ceased and the usages of Antioch-Constantinople
and Rome-Alexandria had become stereotyped in
their respective spheres of influence.</p>

<p>The thirty-six days, as forming a tenth part of the year and
therefore a perfect number, at first found a wide acceptance
(so Cassianus, <i>Coll.</i> xxi. 30); but the inconsistency of this period
with the name Quadragesima, and with the forty days&rsquo; fast of
Christ, came to be noted, and early in the 7th century four days
were added, by what pope is unknown, Lent in the West beginning
henceforth on Ash Wednesday (<i>q.v.</i>). About the same time
the cycle of paschal solemnities was extended to the ninth week
before Easter by the institution of stational masses for Septuagesima,
Sexagesima and Quinquagesima Sundays. At Constantinople,
too, three Sundays were added and associated with the
Easter festival in the same way as the Sundays in Lent proper.
These three Sundays were added in the Greek Church also, and
the present custom of keeping an eight weeks&rsquo; fast (<i>i.e.</i> exactly
8×5 days), now universal in the Eastern Church, originated in
the 7th century. The Greek Lent begins on the Monday of
Sexagesima, with a week of preparatory fasting, known as
<span class="grk" title="turophagia">&#964;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#947;&#953;&#945;</span>, or the &ldquo;butter-week&rdquo;; the actual fast, however,
starts on the Monday of Quinquagesima (Estomihi), this week
being known as &ldquo;the first week of the fast&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="hebdomas tôn nêsteiôn">&#7953;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#8048;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#957;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>).
The period of Lent is still described as &ldquo;the six weeks
of the fast&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="hex hebdomades tôn nêsteiôn">&#7955;&#958; &#7953;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#957;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>), Holy Week (<span class="grk" title="hê hagia kai

retained at the Reformation in some of the reformed Churches,
and is still observed in the Anglican and Lutheran communions.
In England a Lenten fast was first ordered to be observed by
Earconberht, king of Kent (640-664). In the middle ages, meat,
eggs and milk were forbidden in Lent not only by ecclesiastical
but by statute law; and this rule was enforced until the reign of
william III. The chief Lenten food from the earliest days was
fish, and entries in the royal household accounts of Edward III.
show the amount of fish supplied to the king. Herring-pies
were a great delicacy. Charters granted to seaports often
stipulated that the town should send so many herrings or other
fish to the king annually during Lent. How severely strict
medieval abstinence was may be gauged from the fact that
armies and garrisons were sometimes, in default of dispensations,
as in the case of the siege of Orleans in 1429, reduced to starvation
for want of Lenten food, though in full possession of meat and
other supplies. The battle of the Herrings (February 1429)
was fought in order to cover the march of a convoy of Lenten food
to the English army besieging Orleans. Dispensations from
fasting were, however, given in case of illness.</p>

<p>During the religious confusion of the Reformation, the practice
of fasting was generally relaxed and it was found necessary to
reassert the obligation of keeping Lent and the other periods and
days of abstinence by a series of proclamations and statutes.
In these, however, the religious was avowedly subordinate to a
political motive, viz. to prevent the ruin of the fisheries, which
were the great nursery of English seamen. Thus the statute
of 2 and 3 Edward VI., cap. 9 (1549), while inculcating that
&ldquo;due and godly abstinence from flesh is a means to virtue,&rdquo;
adds that &ldquo;by the eating of fish much flesh is saved to the
country,&rdquo; and that thereby, too, the fishing trade is encouraged.
The statute, however, would not seem to have had much effect;
for in spite of a proclamation of Queen Elizabeth in 1560 imposing
a fine of £20 for each offence on butchers slaughtering animals
during Lent, in 1563 Sir William Cecil, in <i>Notes upon an Act for
the Increase of the Navy</i>, says that &ldquo;in old times no flesh at all was
eaten on fish days; even the king himself could not have license;
which was occasion of eating so much fish as now is eaten in flesh
upon fish days.&rdquo; The revolt against fish had ruined the fisheries
and driven the fishermen to turn pirates, to the great scandal
and detriment of the realm. Accordingly, in the session of 1562-1563,
Cecil forced upon an unwilling parliament &ldquo;a politic
ordinance on fish eating,&rdquo; by which the eating of flesh on
fast days was made punishable by a fine of three pounds or
three months&rsquo; imprisonment, one meat dish being allowed on
Wednesdays on condition that three fish dishes were present on
the table. The kind of argument by which Cecil overcame the
Protestant temper of the parliament is illustrated by a clause
which he had meditated adding to the statute, a draft of which
in his own handwriting is preserved: &ldquo;Because no person should
misjudge the intent of the statute,&rdquo; it runs, &ldquo;which is politicly
meant only for the increase of fishermen and mariners, and not
for any superstition for choice of meats; whoever shall preach
or teach that eating of fish or forbearing of flesh is for the saving
of the soul of man, or for the service of God, shall be punished as
the spreader of false news&rdquo; (Dom. MSS., Elizabeth, vol. xxvii.).
But in spite of statutes and proclamations, of occasional severities
and of the patriotic example of Queen Elizabeth, the practice of
fasting fell more and more into disuse. Ostentatious avoidance
of a fish-diet became, indeed, one of the outward symbols of
militant Protestantism among the Puritans. &ldquo;I have often
noted,&rdquo; writes John Taylor, the water-poet, in his <i>Jack a Lent</i>
(1620), &ldquo;that if any superfluous feasting or gormandizing,
paunch-cramming assembly do meet, it is so ordered that it must
be either in Lent, upon a Friday, or a fasting: for the meat
does not relish well except it be sauced with disobedience and
comtempt of authority.&rdquo; The government continued to struggle
against this spirit of defiance; proclamations of James I. in
1619 and 1625, and of Charles I. in 1627 and 1631, again commanded
abstinence from all flesh during Lent, and the High
Church movement of the 17th century lent a fresh religious
sanction to the official attitude. So late as 1687, James II.
issued a proclamation ordering abstention from meat; but,
after the Revolution, the Lenten laws fell obsolete, though they
remained on the statute-book till repealed by the Statute Law
Revision Act 1863. But during the 18th century, though the
strict observance of the Lenten fast was generally abandoned,
it was still observed and inculcated by the more earnest of the
clergy, such as William Law and John Wesley; and the custom
of women wearing mourning in Lent, which had been followed
by Queen Elizabeth and her court, survived until well into the
19th century. With the growth of the Oxford Movement in the
English Church, the practice of observing Lent was revived; and,
though no rules for fasting are authoritatively laid down, the
duty of abstinence is now very generally inculcated by bishops
and clergy, either as a discipline or as an exercise in self-denial.
For the more &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; Churches, Lenten practice tends to
conform to that of the pre-Reformation Church.</p>

<p>Mid-Lent, or the fourth Sunday in Lent, was long known
as <i>Mothering Sunday</i>, in allusion to the custom for girls in
service to be allowed a holiday on that day to visit their
parents. They usually took as a present for their mother a
small cake known as a <i>simnel</i>. In shape it resembled a pork-pie
but in materials it was a rich plum-pudding. The word
is derived through M. Lat. <i>simenellus</i>, <i>simella</i>, from Lat. <i>simila</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
wheat flour. In Gloucestershire simnel cakes are still common;
and at Usk, Monmouth, the custom of mothering is still
scrupulously observed.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LENTHALL, WILLIAM<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1591-1662), English parliamentarian,
speaker of the House of Commons, second son of William Lenthall,
of Lachford, Oxfordshire, a descendent of an old Herefordshire
family, was born at Henley-on-Thames in June 1591. He
left Oxford without taking a degree in 1609, and was called
to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1616, becoming a bencher in 1633.
He represented Woodstock in the Short Parliament (April 1640),
and was chosen by King Charles I. to be speaker of the Long
Parliament, which met on the 3rd of November 1640. According
to Clarendon, a worse choice could not have been made, for
Lenthall was of a &ldquo;very timorous nature.&rdquo; He was treated
with scanty respect in the chair, and seems to have had little
control over the proceedings. On the 4th of January 1642,
however, when the king entered the House of Commons to seize
the five members, Lenthall behaved with great prudence and
dignity. Having taken the speaker&rsquo;s chair and looked round in
vain to discover the offending members, Charles turned to
Lenthall standing below, and demanded of him &ldquo;whether any
of those persons were in the House, whether he saw any of them
and where they were.&rdquo; Lenthall fell on his knees and replied:
&ldquo;May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor
tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to
direct me, whose servant I am here.&rdquo; On the outbreak of the
great rebellion, Lenthall threw in his lot with the parliament.
He had already called attention to the inadequacy of his salary
and been granted a sum of £6000 (9th of April 1642); and he
was now appointed master of the rolls (22nd of November 1643),
and one of the commissioners of the great seal (Oct. 1646-March
1648).</p>

<p>He carried on his duties as speaker without interruption till
1647, when the power of the parliament had been transferred
to the army. On the 26th of July a mob invaded the House of
Commons and obliged it to rescind the ordinance re-establishing
the old parliamentary committee of militia; Lenthall was held
in the chair by main force and compelled to put to the vote a
resolution inviting the king to London. Threats of worse things
came subsequently to Lenthall&rsquo;s ears, and, taking the mace
with him, he left London on the 29th to join the army and
Fairfax. Lenthall and Manchester, the speaker of the Lords,
headed the fugitive members at the review on Hounslow Heath
on the 3rd of August, being received by the soldiers &ldquo;as so many
angels sent from heaven for their good.&rdquo; Returning to London
with the army, he was installed again by Fairfax in the chair
(6th August), and all votes passed during his absence were
annulled. He adhered henceforth to the army party, but with
a constant bias in favour of the king.</p>

<p>At the Restoration he claimed to have sent money to the king
at Oxford, to have provided the queen with comforts and
necessaries and to have taken care of the royal children. But
he put the question for the king&rsquo;s trial from the chair, and
continued to act as speaker after the king&rsquo;s execution. He
still continued to use his influence in favour of the royalists,
whenever this was possible without imperilling his own interests,
and he saved the lives of both the earl of Norwich (8th March
1649) and Sir W. D&rsquo;Avenant (3rd July 1650) by his casting
vote. The removal of the king had left the parliament supreme;
and Lenthall as its representative, though holding little real
power, was the first man in the state.</p>

<p>His speakership continued till the 20th of April 1653, when
the Long Parliament was summarily expelled. Cromwell directed
Colonel Harrison, on the refusal of Lenthall to quit the chair,
to pull him out&mdash;and Lenthall submitted to the show of force.
He took no part in politics till the assembling of the first protectorate
parliament, on the 3rd of September 1654, in which
he sat as member for Oxfordshire. He was again chosen speaker,
his former experience and his pliability of character being his
chief recommendations. In the second protectorate parliament,
summoned by Cromwell on the 17th of September 1656, Lenthall
was again chosen member for Oxfordshire, but had some difficulty
in obtaining admission, and was not re-elected speaker. He
supported Cromwell&rsquo;s administration, and was active in urging
the protector to take the title of king. In spite of his services,
Lenthall was not included by Cromwell in his new House of
Lords, and was much disappointed and crestfallen at his omission.
The protector, hearing of his &ldquo;grievous complaint,&rdquo; sent him a
writ, and Lenthall was elated at believing he had secured a
peerage. After Cromwell&rsquo;s death, the officers, having determined
to recall the &ldquo;Rump&rdquo; Parliament, assembled at Lenthall&rsquo;s
house at the Rolls (6th May 1659), to desire him to send out the
writs. Lenthall, however, had no wish to resume his duties
as speaker, preferring the House of Lords, and made various
excuses for not complying. Nevertheless, upon the officers
threatening to summon the parliament without his aid, and
hearing the next morning that several members had assembled,
he led the procession to the parliament house. Lenthall was
now restored to the position of dignity which he had filled before.
He was temporarily made keeper of the new great seal (14th of
May). On the 6th of June it was voted that all commissions
should be signed by Lenthall and not by the commander-in-chief.
His exalted position, however, was not left long unassailed.
On the 13th of October Lambert placed soldiers round the House
and prevented the members from assembling. Lenthall&rsquo;s coach
was stopped as he was entering Palace Yard, the mace was seized
and he was obliged to return. The army, however, soon returned
to their allegiance to the parliament. On the 24th of December
they marched to Lenthall&rsquo;s house, and expressed their sorrow.
On the 29th the speaker received the thanks of the reassembled
parliament.</p>

<p>Lenthall now turned his attention to bring about the Restoration.
He &ldquo;very violently&rdquo; opposed the oath abjuring the house
of Stuart, now sought to be imposed by the republican faction
on the parliament, and absented himself from the House for ten
days, to avoid, it was said, any responsibility for the bill. He had
been in communication with Monk for some time, and on Monk
entering London with his army (3rd February 1660) Lenthall met
him in front of Somerset House. On the 6th of February Monk
visited the House of Commons, when Lenthall pronounced a
speech of thanks. On the 28th of March Lenthall forwarded
to the king a paper containing &ldquo;Heads of Advice.&rdquo; According
to Monk, he &ldquo;was very active for the restoring of His Majesty
and performed many services ... which could not have been
soe well effected without his helpe.&rdquo; Lenthall notwithstanding
found himself in disgrace at the Restoration. In spite of Monk&rsquo;s
recommendation, he was not elected by Oxford University for
the Convention Parliament, nor was he allowed by the king,
though he had sent him a present of £3000, to remain master of
the rolls. On the 11th of June he was included by the House
of Commons, in spite of a recommendatory letter from Monk,
among the twenty persons excepted from the act of indemnity
and subject to penalties not extending to life. In the House of
Lords, however, Monk&rsquo;s testimony and intercession were effectual,
and Lenthall was only declared incapable of holding for the future
any public office. His last public act was a disgraceful one.
Unmindful now of the privileges of parliament, he consented to
appear as a witness against the regicide Thomas Scot, for words
spoken in the House of Commons while Lenthall was in the
chair. It was probably after this that he was allowed to present
himself at court, and his contemporaries took a malicious glee
in telling how &ldquo;when, with some difficulty, he obtained leave to
kiss the king&rsquo;s hand he, out of guilt, fell backward, as he was
kneeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lenthall died on the 3rd of September 1662. In his will he
desired to be buried without any state and without a monument,
&ldquo;but at the utmost a plain stone with this superscription only,
<i>Vermis sum</i>, acknowledging myself to be unworthy of the least
outward regard in this world and unworthy of any remembrance
that hath been so great a sinner.&rdquo; He was held in little honour
by his contemporaries, and was universally regarded as a time-server.
He was, however, a man of good intentions, strong
family affections and considerable ability. Unfortunately he
was called by the irony of fate to fill a great office, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
governed constantly by fears for his person and estate, he was
seduced into a series of unworthy actions. He left one son, Sir
John Lenthall, who had descendants. His brother, Sir John
Lenthall, who, it was said, had too much influence with him,
was notorious for his extortions as keeper of the King&rsquo;s Bench
prison.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENTIL,<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> the seed of <i>Lens esculenta</i> (also known as <i>Ervum Lens</i>),
a small annual of the vetch tribe. The plant varies from 6 to
18 in. in height, and has many long ascending branches. The
leaves are alternate, with six pairs of oblong-linear, obtuse,
mucronate leaflets. The flowers, two to four in number, are
of a pale blue colour, and are borne in the axils of the leaves,
on a slender footstalk nearly equalling the leaves in length;
they are produced in June or early in July. The pods are about
½ in. long, broadly oblong, slightly inflated, and contain two seeds,
which are of the shape of a doubly convex lens, and about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> in.
in diameter. There are several cultivated varieties of the plant,
differing in size, hairiness and colour of the leaves, flowers and
seeds. The last may be more or less compressed in shape, and
in colour may vary from yellow or grey to dark brown; they are
also sometimes mottled or speckled. In English commerce two
kinds of lentils are principally met with, French and Egyptian.
The former are usually sold entire, and are of an ash-grey
colour externally and of a yellow tint within; the latter are
usually sold like split peas, without the seed coat, and consist of
the reddish-yellow cotyledons, which are smaller and rounder
than those of the French lentil; the seed coat when present
is of a dark brown colour. Considerable quantities of lentils are
also imported into the United States.</p>

<p>The native country of the lentil is not known. It was probably
one of the first plants brought under cultivation by mankind;
lentils have been found in the lake dwellings of St Peter&rsquo;s Island,
Lake of Bienne, which are of the Bronze age. The name &lsquo;adas
(Heb. <span title="adash">&#1506;&#1491;&#1513;</span>) appears to be an original Semitic word, and the red
pottage of lentils for which Esau sold his birthright (Gen. xxv. 34)
was apparently made from the red Egyptian lentil. This lentil
is cultivated in one or other variety in India, Persia, Syria,
Egypt, Nubia and North Africa, and in Europe, along the coast
of the Mediterranean, and as far north as Germany, Holland and
France. In Egypt, Syria and other Eastern countries the parched
seeds are exposed for sale in shops, and esteemed the best food
to carry on long journeys. Lentils form a chief ingredient in the
Spanish puchero, and are used in a similar way in France and other
countries. For this purpose they are usually sold in the shelled
state.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The reddish variety of the lentil (<i>lentillon d&rsquo;hiver</i>) is the kind
most esteemed in Paris on account of the superior flavour of its
smaller seeds. It is sown in autumn either with a cereal crop or
alone, and is cultivated chiefly in the north and east of France. The
large or common variety, <i>lentille large blonde</i>, cultivated in Lorraine
and at Gallardon (Eure-et-Loir), and largely in Germany, is the
most productive, but is less esteemed. This kind has very small
whitish flowers, two or rarely three on a footstalk, and the pods are
generally one-seeded, the seeds being of a whitish or cream colour,
about <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> of an inch broad and <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. thick. A single plant produces
from 100 to 150 pods, which are flattened, about ¾ in. long and ½ in.
broad. Another variety, with seeds similar in form and colour to
the last, but of much smaller size, is known as the <i>lentillon de Mars</i>.
It is sown in spring. This variety and the <i>lentille large</i> are both
sometimes called the <i>lentille à la reine</i>. A small variety, <i>lentille
verte du Puy</i>, cultivated chiefly in the departments of Haute Loire
and Cantal, is also grown as a vegetable and for forage. The Egyptian
lentil was introduced into Britain in 1820. It has blue flowers.
Another species of lentil, <i>Ervum monanthos</i>, is grown in France about
Orleans and elsewhere under the name of <i>jarosse</i> and <i>jarande</i>. It is,
according to Vilmorin, one of the best kinds of green food to grow
on a poor dry sandy soil; on calcareous soil it does not succeed so
well. It is usually sown in autumn with a little rye or winter oats,
at the rate of a hectolitre to a hectare.</p>

<p>The lentil prefers a light warm sandy soil; on rich land it runs
to leaf and produces but few pods. The seeds are sown in March
or April or early in May, according to the climate of the country, as
they cannot endure night frosts. If for fodder they are sown broadcast,
but in drills if the ripe seeds are required. The pods are
gathered in August or September, as soon as they begin to turn
brown&mdash;the plants being pulled up like flax while the foliage is still
green, and on a dry day lest the pods split in drying and loss of
seed takes place. Lentils keep best in the husk so far as flavour is
concerned, and will keep good in this way for two years either for
sowing or for food. An acre of ground yields on an average about
11 cwt. of seed and 30 cwt. of straw. The amount and character
of the mineral matter requisite in the soil may be judged from the
analysis of the ash, which in the seeds has as its chief ingredients&mdash;potash
34.6%, soda 9.5, lime 6.3, phosphoric acid 36.2, chloride of
sodium 7.6, while in the straw the percentages are&mdash;potash 10.8,
lime 52.3, silica 17.6, phosphoric acid 12.3, chloride of sodium 2.1.</p>

<p>Lentils have attracted considerable notice among vegetarians
as a food material, especially for soup. A Hindu proverb says,
&ldquo;Rice is good, but lentils are my life.&rdquo; The husk of the seed is
indigestible, and to cook lentils properly requires at least two and a
half hours, but they are richer in nutritious matter than almost any
other kind of pulse, containing, according to Payen&rsquo;s analysis, 25.2%
of nitrogenous matter (legumin), 56% of starch and 2.6% of
fatty matter. Fresenius&rsquo;s analysis differs in giving only 35% of
starch; Einhoff gives 32.81 of starch and 37.82% of nitrogenous
matter. Lentils are more properly the food of the poor in all countries
where they are grown, and have often been spurned when better
food could be obtained, hence the proverb <i>Dives factus jam desiit
gaudere lente</i>. The seeds are said to be good for pigeons, or mixed
in a ground state with potatoes or barley for fattening pigs. The
herbage is highly esteemed as green food for suckling ewes and all
kinds of cattle (being said to increase the yield of milk), also for
calves and lambs. Haller says that lentils are so flatulent as to kill
horses. They were also believed to be the cause of severe scrofulous
disorders common in Egypt. This bad reputation may possibly be
due to the substitution of the seeds of the bitter vetch or tare lentil,
<i>Ervum Ervilia</i>, a plant which closely resembles the true lentil in
height, habit, flower and pod, but whose seeds are without doubt
possessed of deleterious properties&mdash;producing weakness or even
paralysis of the extremities in horses which have partaken of them.
The poisonous principle seems to reside chiefly in the bitter seed
coat, and can apparently be removed by steeping in water, since
Gerard, speaking of the &ldquo;bitter vetch&rdquo; (<i>E. Ervilia</i>), says &ldquo;kine in
Asia and in most other countries do eat thereof, being made sweet
by steeping in water.&rdquo; The seed of <i>E. Ervilia</i> is about the same size
and almost exactly of the same reddish-brown colour as that of the
Egyptian lentil, and when the seed coat is removed they are both
of the same orange red hue, but the former is not so bright as the
latter. The shape is the best means of distinguishing the two seeds,
that of E. <i>Ervilia</i> being obtusely triangular.</p>

<p>Sea-lentil is a name sometimes applied to the gulfweed <i>Sargassum
vulgare</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENTULUS,<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> the name of a Roman patrician family of the
Cornelian gens, derived from <i>lentes</i> (&ldquo;lentils&rdquo;), which its oldest
members were fond of cultivating (according to Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i>
xviii. 3, 10). The word <i>Lentulitas</i> (&ldquo;Lentulism&rdquo;; cf. <i>Appietas</i>)
is coined by Cicero (<i>Ad Fam.</i> iii. 7, 5) to express the attributes
of a pronounced aristocrat. The three first of the name were
L. Cornelius Lentulus (consul 327 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Servius Cornelius
Lentulus (consul 303) and L. Cornelius Lentulus Caudinus
(consul 275). Their connexion with the later Lentuli (especially
those of the Ciceronian period) is very obscure and difficult to
establish. The following members of the family deserve mention.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Publius Cornelius Lentulus</span>, nicknamed <span class="sc">Sura</span>, one of
the chief figures in the Catilinarian conspiracy. When accused
by Sulla (to whom he had been quaestor in 81 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) of having
squandered the public money, he refused to render any account,
but insolently held out the calf of his leg (<i>sura</i>), on which part
of the person boys were punished when they made mistakes
in playing ball. He was praetor in 75, governor of Sicily 74,
consul 71. In 70, being expelled from the senate with a number
of others for immorality, he joined Catiline. Relying upon a
Sibylline oracle that three Cornelii should be rulers of Rome,
Lentulus regarded himself as the destined successor of Cornelius
Sulla and Cornelius Cinna. When Catiline left Rome after
Cicero&rsquo;s first speech <i>In Catilinam</i>, Lentulus took his place as
chief of the conspirators in the city. In conjunction with C.
Cornelius Cethegus, he undertook to murder Cicero and set
fire to Rome, but the plot failed owing to his timidity and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span>
indiscretion. Ambassadors from the Allobroges being at the
time in Rome, the bearers of a complaint against the oppressions
of provincial governors, Lentulus made overtures to them, with
the object of obtaining armed assistance. Pretending to fall
in with his views, the ambassadors obtained a written agreement
signed by the chief conspirators, and informed Q. Fabius
Sanga, their &ldquo;patron&rdquo; in Rome, who in his turn acquainted
Cicero. The conspirators were arrested and forced to admit
their guilt. Lentulus was compelled to abdicate his praetorship,
and, as it was feared that there might be an attempt to rescue
him, he was put to death in the Tullianum on the 5th of
December 63.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="sc">Publius Cornelius Lentulus</span>, called <span class="sc">Spinther</span> from his
likeness to an actor of that name, one of the chief adherents
of the Pompeian party. In 63 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he was curule aedile, assisted
Cicero in the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and
distinguished himself by the splendour of the games he provided.
Praetor in 60, he obtained the governorship of Hispania Citerior
(59) through the support of Caesar, to whom he was also indebted
for his election to the consulship (57). Lentulus played a
prominent part in the recall of Cicero from exile, and although
a temporary coolness seems to have arisen between them, Cicero
speaks of him in most grateful terms. From 56-53 Lentulus
was governor of the province of Cilicia (with Cyprus) and during
that time was commissioned by the senate to restore Ptolemy XI.
Auletes to his kingdom (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ptolemies</a></span>). The Sibylline books,
however, declared that the king must not be restored by force
of arms, at the risk of peril to Rome. As a provincial governor,
Lentulus appears to have looked after the interests of his subjects,
and did not enrich himself at their expense. In spite of his
indebtedness to Caesar, Lentulus joined the Pompeians on the
outbreak of civil war (49). The generosity with which he was
treated by Caesar after the capitulation of Corfinium made
him hesitate, but he finally decided in favour of Pompey. After
the battle of Pharsalus, Lentulus escaped to Rhodes, where he
was at first refused admission, although he subsequently found
an asylum there (Cicero, <i>Ad Att.</i> xi. 13. 1). According to
Aurelius Victor (<i>De vir. ill.</i> lxxviii., 9, if the reading be correct),
he subsequently fell into Caesar&rsquo;s hands and was put to death.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lucius Cornelius Lentulus</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">Crus</span> or <span class="sc">Cruscello</span>
(for what reason is unknown), member of the anti-Caesarian
party. In 61 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he was the chief accuser of P. Clodius (<i>q.v.</i>) in
the affair of the festival of Bona Dea. When consul (49) he
advised the rejection of all peace terms offered by Caesar, and
declared that, if the senate did not at once decide upon opposing
him by force of arms, he would act upon his own responsibility.
There seems no reason to doubt that Lentulus was mainly
inspired by selfish motives, and hoped to find in civil war an
opportunity for his own aggrandizement. But in spite of his
brave words he fled in haste from Rome as soon as he heard of
Caesar&rsquo;s advance, and crossed over to Greece. After Pharsalus,
he made his way to Rhodes (but was refused admission), thence,
by way of Cyprus, to Egypt. He landed at Pelusium the day
after the murder of Pompey, was immediately seized by Ptolemy,
imprisoned, and put to death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LENZ, JAKOB MICHAEL REINHOLD<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (1751-1792), German
poet, was born at Sesswegen in Livonia, the son of the village
pastor, on the 12th of January 1751. He removed with his
parents to Dorpat in 1759, and soon began to compose sacred
odes, in the manner of Klopstock. In 1768 he entered the
university of Königsberg as a student of theology, and in 1771
accompanied, as tutor, two young German nobles, named von
Kleist, to Strassburg, where they were to enter the French
army. In Strassburg Lenz was received into the literary circle
that gathered round Friedrich Rudolf Salzmann (1749-1821)
and became acquainted with Goethe, at that time a student at
the university. In order to be close to his young pupils, Lenz
had to remove to Fort Louis in the neighbourhood, and while
here became deeply enamoured of Goethe&rsquo;s friend, Friederike
Elisabeth Brion (1752-1813), daughter of the pastor of Sesenheim.
Lenz endeavoured, after Goethe&rsquo;s departure from Strassburg,
to replace the great poet in her affections, and to her he poured
out songs and poems (<i>Die Liebe auf dem Lande</i>) which were long
attributed to Goethe himself, as was also Lenz&rsquo;s first drama, the
comedy, <i>Der Hofmeister, oder Vorteile der Privaterziehung</i> (1774).
In 1776 he visited Weimar and was most kindly received by the
duke; but his rude, overbearing manner and vicious habits
led to his expulsion. In 1777 he became insane, and in 1779
was removed from Emmendingen, where J. G. Schlosser (1739-1799),
Goethe&rsquo;s brother-in-law, had given him a home, to his
native village. Here he lived in great poverty for several years,
and then was given, more out of charity than on account of his
merits, the appointment of tutor in a pension school near
Moscow, where he died on the 24th of May 1792. Lenz, though
one of the most talented poets of the <i>Sturm und Drang</i> period,
presented a strange medley of genius and childishness. His
great, though neglected and distorted, abilities found vent in
ill-conceived imitations of Shakespeare. His comedies, <i>Der
Hofmeister</i>; <i>Der neue Menoza</i> (1774); <i>Die Soldaten</i> (1776);
<i>Die Freunde machen den Philosophen</i> (1776), though accounted
the best of his works, are characterized by unnatural situations
and an incongruous mixture of tragedy and comedy.</p>

<p>Lenz&rsquo;s <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> were published by L. Tieck in three

<p><span class="bold">LEO,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> the name of thirteen popes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo I.</span>, who alone of Roman pontiffs shares with Gregory I.
the surname of <span class="sc">the Great</span>, pope from 440 to 461, was a native
of Rome, or, according to a less probable account, of Volterra
in Tuscany. Of his family or early life nothing is known; that
he was highly cultivated according to the standards of his time
is obvious, but it does not appear that he could write Greek,
or even that he understood that language. In one of the letters
(<i>Ep.</i> 104) of Augustine, an acolyte named Leo is mentioned
as having been in 418 the bearer of a communication from
Sixtus of Rome (afterwards pope) to Aurelius of Carthage
against the Pelagians. In 429, when the first unmistakable
reference to Pope Leo occurs, he was still only a deacon, but
already a man of commanding influence; it was at his suggestion
that the <i>De incarnatione</i> of the aged Cassianus, having reference
to the Nestorian heresy, was composed in that year, and about
431 we find Cyril of Alexandria writing to him that he might
prevent the Roman Church from lending its support in any
way to the ambitious schemes of Juvenal of Jerusalem. In 440,
while Leo was in Gaul, whither he had been sent to compose
some differences between Aetius and another general named
Albinus, Pope Sixtus III. died. The absent deacon, or rather
archdeacon, was unanimously chosen to succeed him, and
received consecration on his return six weeks afterwards
(September 29). In 443 he began to take measures against the
Manichaeans (who since the capture of Carthage by Genseric
in 439 had become very numerous at Rome), and in the following
year he was able to report to the Italian bishops that some of
the heretics had returned to Catholicism, while a large number
had been sentenced to perpetual banishment &ldquo;in accordance
with the constitutions of the Christian emperors,&rdquo; and others
had fled; in seeking these out the help of the provincial clergy
was sought. It was during the earlier years of Leo&rsquo;s pontificate
that the events in Gaul occurred which resulted in this triumph
over Hilarius of Arles, signalized by the edict of Valentinian III.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>
(445), denouncing the contumacy of the Gallic bishop, and
enacting &ldquo;that nothing should be done in Gaul, contrary to
ancient usage, without the authority of the bishop of Rome,
and that the decree of the apostolic see should henceforth be
law.&rdquo; In 447 Leo held the correspondence with Turribus of
Astorga which led to the condemnation of the Priscillianists by the
Spanish national church. In 448 he received with commendation
a letter from Eutyches, the Constantinopolitan monk, complaining
of the revival of the Nestorian heresy there; and in
the following year Eutyches wrote his circular, appealing against
the sentence which at the instance of Eusebius of Dorylaeum
had been passed against him at a synod held in Constantinople
under the presidency of the patriarch Flavian, and asking papal
support at the oecumenical council at that time under summons
to meet at Ephesus. The result of a correspondence was that
Leo by his legates sent to Flavian that famous epistle in which
he sets forth with great fulness of detail the doctrine ever since
recognized as orthodox regarding the union of the two natures
in the one person of Jesus Christ. The events at the &ldquo;robber&rdquo;
synod at Ephesus belong to general church history rather than
to the biography of Leo; his letter, though submitted, was not
read by the assembled fathers, and the papal legates had some
difficulty in escaping with their lives from the violence of the
theologians who, not content with deposing Flavian and Eusebius,
shouted for the dividing of those who divided Christ. When the
news of the result of this oecumenical council (oecumenical
in every circumstance except that it was not presided over
by the pope) reached Rome, Leo wrote to Theodosius &ldquo;with
groanings and tears,&rdquo; requesting the emperor to sanction another
council, to be held this time, however, in Italy. In this petition
he was supported by Valentinian III., by the empress-mother
Galla Placidia and by the empress Eudoxia, but the appeal
was made in vain. A change, however, was brought about by
the accession in the following year of Marcian, who three days
after coming to the throne published an edict bringing within
the scope of the penal laws against heretics the supporters of
the dogmas of Apollinaris and Eutyches. To convoke a synod
in which greater orthodoxy might reasonably be expected
was in these circumstances no longer difficult, but all Leo&rsquo;s
efforts to secure that the meeting should take place on Italian
soil were unavailing. When the synod of Chalcedon assembled
in 451, the papal legates were treated with great respect, and
Leo&rsquo;s former letter to Flavian was adopted by acclamation
as formulating the creed of the universal church on the subject
of the person of Christ. Among the reasons urged by Leo for
holding this council in Italy had been the threatening attitude
of the Huns; the dreaded irruption took place in the following
year (452). After Aquileia had succumbed to Attila&rsquo;s long
siege, the conqueror set out for Rome. Near the confluence
of the Mincio and the Po he was met by Leo, whose eloquence
persuaded him to turn back. Legend has sought to enhance
the impressiveness of the occurrence by an unnecessarily imagined
miracle. The pope was less successful with Genseric when the
Vandal chief arrived under the walls of Rome in 455, but he
secured a promise that there should be no incendiarism or
murder, and that three of the oldest basilicas should be exempt
from plunder&mdash;a promise which seems to have been faithfully
observed. Leo died on the 10th of November 461, the liturgical
anniversary being the 11th of April. His successor was Hilarius
or Hilarus, who had been one of the papal legates at the &ldquo;robber&rdquo;
synod in 449.</p>

<p>The title of <i>doctor ecclesiae</i> was given to Leo by Benedict
XIV. As bishop of the diocese of Rome, Leo distinguished
himself above all his predecessors by his preaching, to which
he devoted himself with great zeal and success. From his short
and pithy <i>Sermones</i> many of the lessons now to be found in the
Roman breviary have been taken. Viewed in conjunction
with his voluminous correspondence, the sermons sufficiently
explain the secret of his greatness, which chiefly lay in the
extraordinary strength and purity of his convictions as to the
primacy of the successors of St Peter at a time when the civil
and ecclesiastical troubles of the civilized world made men
willing enough to submit themselves to any authority whatsoever
that could establish its right to exist by courage, honesty and
knowledge of affairs.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The works of Leo I. were first collectively edited by Quesnel
(Lyons, 1700), and again, on the basis of this, in what is now the
standard edition by Ballerini (Venice, 1753-1756). Ninety-three
Sermones and one hundred and seventy-three <i>Epistolae</i> occupy the
first volume; the second contains the <i>Liber Sacramentorum</i>, usually
attributed to Leo, and the <i>De Vocatione Omnium Gentium</i>, also
ascribed, by Quesnel and others, to him, but more probably the
production of a certain Prosper, of whom nothing further is known.
The works of Hilary of Arles are appended.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Leo II.</span>, pope from August 682 to July 683, was a Sicilian by
birth, and succeeded Agatho I. Agatho had been represented
at the sixth oecumenical council (that of Constantinople in
681), where Pope Honorius I. was anathematized for his views
in the Monothelite controversy as a favourer of heresy, and
the only fact of permanent historical interest with regard to Leo
is that he wrote once and again in approbation of the decision
of the council and in condemnation of Honorius, whom he
regarded as one who <i>profana proditione immaculatam fidem
subvertere conatus est</i>. In their bearing upon the question of
papal infallibility these words have excited considerable attention
and controversy, and prominence is given to the circumstance
that in the Greek text of the letter to the emperor in which the
phrase occurs the milder expression <span class="grk" title="parechôrêsen">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#967;&#974;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> (<i>subverti
permisit</i>) is used for subvertere conatus est. This Hefele in his
<i>Conciliengeschichte</i> (iii. 294) regards as alone expressing the
true meaning of Leo. It was during Leo&rsquo;s pontificate that the
dependence of the see of Ravenna upon that of Rome was finally
settled by imperial edict. Benedict II. succeeded him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo III.</span>, whose pontificate (795-816) covered the last eighteen
years of the reign of Charlemagne, was a native of Rome, and
having been chosen successor of Adrian I. on the 26th of
December 795, was consecrated to the office on the following
day. His first act was to send to Charles as patrician the standard
of Rome along with the keys of the sepulchre of St Peter and of
the city; a gracious and condescending letter in reply made it
still more clear where all real power at that moment lay. For
more than three years his term of office was uneventful; but
at the end of that period the feelings of disappointment which
had secretly been rankling in the breasts of Paschalis and
Campulus, nephews of Adrian I., who had received from him the
offices of <i>primicerius</i> and <i>sacellarius</i> respectively, suddenly
manifested themselves in an organized attack upon Leo as he
was riding in procession through the city on the day of the
Greater Litany (25th April 799); the object of his assailants
was, by depriving him of his eyes and tongue, to disqualify him
for the papal office, and, although they were unsuccessful in this
attempt, he found it necessary to accept the protection of
Winegis, the Frankish duke of Spoleto, who came to the rescue.
Having vainly requested the presence of Charles in Rome, Leo
went beyond the Alps to meet the king at Paderborn; he was
received with much ceremony and respect, but his enemies
having sent in serious written charges, of which the character
is not now known, Charles decided to appoint both the pope
and his accusers to appear as parties before him when he should
have arrived in Rome. Leo returned in great state to his diocese,
and was received with honour; Charles, who did not arrive
until November in the following year, lost no time in assuming
the office of a judge, and the result of his investigation was the
acquittal of the pope, who at the same time, however, was permitted
or rather required to clear himself by the oath of compurgation.
The coronation of the emperor followed two days
afterwards; its effect was to bring out with increased clearness
the personally subordinate position of Leo. The decision of the
emperor, however, secured for Leo&rsquo;s pontificate an external
peace which was only broken after the accession of Louis the
Pious. His enemies began to renew their attacks; the violent
repression of a conspiracy led to an open rebellion at Rome;
serious charges were once more brought against him, when he was
overtaken by death in 816. It was under this pontificate that
Felix of Urgel, the adoptianist, was anathematized (798) by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
Roman synod. Leo at another synod held in Rome in 810
admitted the dogmatic correctness of the <i><span class="correction" title="amended from filoque">filioque</span></i>, but deprecated
its introduction into the creed. On this point, however, the
Frankish Church persevered in the course it had already initiated.
Leo&rsquo;s successor was Stephen IV.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo IV.</span>, pope from 847 to 855, was a Roman by birth, and
succeeded Sergius II. His pontificate was chiefly distinguished
by his efforts to repair the damage done by the Saracens during
the reign of his predecessor to various churches of the city,
especially those of St Peter and St Paul. It was he who built
and fortified the suburb on the right bank of the Tiber still
known as the Civitas Leonina. A frightful conflagration, which
he is said to have extinguished by his prayers, is the subject
of Raphael&rsquo;s great work in the Sala dell&rsquo; Incendio of the Vatican.
He held three synods, one of them (in 850) distinguished by the
presence of Louis II., who was crowned emperor on the occasion,
but none of them otherwise of importance. The history of the
papal struggle with Hincmar of Reims, which began during Leo&rsquo;s
pontificate, belongs rather to that of Nicholas I. Benedict III.
was Leo&rsquo;s immediate successor.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo V.</span>, a native of Ardea, was pope for two months in 903 after
the death of Benedict IV. He was overthrown and cast into prison
by the priest Christopher, who installed himself in his place.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo VI.</span> succeeded John X. in 928, and reigned seven months
and a few days. He was succeeded by Stephen VIII.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo VII.</span>, pope from 936 to 939, was preceded by John XI.,
and followed by Stephen IX.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo VIII.</span>, pope from 963 to 965, a Roman by birth, held the
lay office of <i>protoscrinius</i> when he was elected to the papal chair
at the instance of Otto the Great by the Roman synod which
deposed John XII. in December 963. Having been hurried with
unseemly haste through all the intermediate orders, he received
consecration two days after his election, which was unacceptable
to the people. In February 964, the emperor having withdrawn
from the city, Leo found it necessary to seek safety in flight,
whereupon he was deposed by a synod held under the presidency
of John XII. On the sudden death of the latter, the populace
chose Benedict V. as his successor; but Otto, returning and
laying siege to the city, compelled their acceptance of Leo. It
is usually said that, at the synod which deposed Benedict, Leo
conceded to the emperor and his successors as sovereign of Italy
full rights of investiture, but the genuineness of the document
on which this allegation rests is more than doubtful. Leo VIII.
was succeeded by John XIII.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo IX.</span>, pope from 1049 to 1054, was a native of Upper
Alsace, where he was born on the 21st of June 1002. His proper
name was Bruno; the family to which he belonged was of noble
rank, and through his father he was related to the emperor
Conrad II. He was educated at Toul, where he successively
became canon and (1026) bishop; in the latter capacity he
rendered important political services to his relative Conrad II.,
and afterwards to Henry III., and at the same time he became
widely known as an earnest and reforming ecclesiastic by the zeal
he showed in spreading the rule of the order of Cluny. On the
death of Damasus II., Bruno was in December 1048, with the
concurrence both of the emperor and of the Roman delegates,
selected his successor by an assembly at Worms; he stipulated,
however, as a condition of his acceptance that he should first
proceed to Rome and be canonically elected by the voice of clergy
and people. Setting out shortly after Christmas, he had a meeting
with abbot Hugo of Cluny at Besançon, where he was joined
by the young monk Hildebrand, who afterwards became Pope
Gregory VII.; arriving in pilgrim garb at Rome in the following
February, he was received with much cordiality, and at his
consecration assumed the name of Leo IX. One of his first
public acts was to hold the well-known Easter synod of 1049,
at which celibacy of the clergy (down to the rank of subdeacon)
was anew enjoined, and where he at least succeeded in making
clear his own convictions against every kind of simony. The
greater part of the year that followed was occupied in one of
those progresses through Italy, Germany and France which
form a marked feature in Leo&rsquo;s pontificate. After presiding
over a synod at Pavia, he joined the emperor Henry III. in
Saxony, and accompanied him to Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle;
to Reims he also summoned a meeting of the higher clergy,
by which several important reforming decrees were passed. At
Mainz also he held a council, at which the Italian and French
as well as the German clergy were represented, and ambassadors
of the Greek emperor were present; here too simony and the
marriage of the clergy were the principal matters dealt with.
After his return to Rome he held (29th April 1050) another
Easter synod, which was occupied largely with the controversy
about the teachings of Berengarius of Tours; in the same year
he presided over provincial synods at Salerno, Siponto and
Vercelli, and in September revisited Germany, returning to Rome
in time for a third Easter synod, at which the question of the
reordination of those who had been ordained by simonists was
considered. In 1052 he joined the emperor at Pressburg, and
vainly sought to secure the submission of the Hungarians; and
at Regensburg, Bamberg and Worms the papal presence was
marked by various ecclesiastical solemnities. After a fourth
Easter synod in 1053 Leo set out against the Normans in the
south with an army of Italians and German volunteers, but his
forces sustained a total defeat at Astagnum near Civitella (18th
June 1053); on going out, however, from the city to meet the
enemy he was received with every token of submission, relief
from the pressure of his ban was implored and fidelity and
homage were sworn. From June 1053 to March 1054 he was
nevertheless detained at Benevento in honourable captivity;
he did not long survive his return to Rome, where he died on
the 19th of April 1054. He was succeeded by Victor II.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo X.</span> [Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici] (1475-1521), pope from the 11th
of March 1513 to the 1st of December 1521, was the second son
of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici, called the Magnificent, and was born at
Florence on the 11th of December 1475. Destined from his birth
for the church, he received the tonsure at the age of seven and
was soon loaded with rich benefices and preferments. His father
prevailed on Innocent VIII. to name him cardinal-deacon of
Sta Maria in Dominica in March 1489, although he was not
allowed to wear the insignia or share in the deliberations of the
college until three years later. Meanwhile he received a careful
education at Lorenzo&rsquo;s brilliant humanistic court under such men
as Angelo Poliziano, the classical scholar, Pico della Mirandola,
the philosopher and theologian, the pious Marsilio Ficino who
endeavoured to unite the Platonic cult with Christianity and
the poet Bernardo Dovizio Bibbiena. From 1489 to 1491 he
studied theology and canon law at Pisa under Filippo Decio
and Bartolomeo Sozzini. On the 23rd of March 1492 he was
formally admitted into the sacred college and took up his residence
at Rome, receiving a letter of advice from his father which ranks
among the wisest of its kind. The death of Lorenzo on the 8th
of April, however, called the seventeen-year-old cardinal to
Florence. He participated in the conclave which followed
the death of Innocent VIII. in July 1492 and opposed the
election of Cardinal Borgia. He made his home with his
elder brother Piero at Florence throughout the agitation of
Savonarola and the invasion of Charles VIII. of France, until
the uprising of the Florentines and the expulsion of the
Medici in November 1494. While Piero found refuge at Venice
and Urbino, Cardinal Giovanni travelled in Germany, in the
Netherlands and in France. In May 1500 he returned to Rome,
where he was received with outward cordiality by Alexander VI.,
and where he lived for several years immersed in art and literature.
In 1503 he welcomed the accession of Julius II. to the
pontificate; the death of Piero de&rsquo; Medici in the same year
made Giovanni head of his family. On the 1st of October 1511
he was appointed papal legate of Bologna and the Romagna,
and when the Florentine republic declared in favour of the
schismatic Pisans Julius II. sent him against his native city at
the head of the papal army. This and other attempts to regain
political control of Florence were frustrated, until a bloodless
revolution permitted the return of the Medici on the 14th of
September 1512. Giovanni&rsquo;s younger brother Giuliano was
placed at the head of the republic, but the cardinal actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span>
managed the government. Julius II. died in February 1513, and
the conclave, after a stormy seven day&rsquo;s session, united on Cardinal
de&rsquo; Medici as the candidate of the younger cardinals. He was
ordained to the priesthood on the 15th of March, consecrated
bishop on the 17th, and enthroned with the name of Leo X. on
the 19th. There is no evidence of simony in the conclave, and
Leo&rsquo;s election was hailed with delight by the Romans on account
of his reputation for liberality, kindliness and love of peace.
Following the example of many of his predecessors, he promptly
repudiated his election &ldquo;capitulation&rdquo; as an infringement on
the divinely bestowed prerogatives of the Holy See.</p>

<p>Many problems confronted Leo X. on his accession. He
must preserve the papal conquests which he had inherited from
Alexander VI. and Julius II. He must minimize foreign influence,
whether French, Spanish or German, in Italy. He must put an
end to the Pisan schism and settle the other troubles incident
to the French invasion. He must restore the French Church to
Catholic unity, abolish the pragmatic sanction of Bourges, and
bring to a successful close the Lateran council convoked by his
predecessor. He must stay the victorious advance of the Turks.
He must quiet the disagreeable wranglings of the German
humanists. Other problems connected with his family interests
served to complicate the situation and eventually to prevent the
successful consummation of many of his plans. At the very time
of Leo&rsquo;s accession Louis XII. of France, in alliance with Venice,
was making a determined effort to regain the duchy of Milan,
and the pope, after fruitless endeavours to maintain peace, joined
the league of Mechlin on the 5th of April 1513 with the emperor
Maximilian I., Ferdinand I. of Spain and Henry VIII. of England.
The French and Venetians were at first successful, but on the 6th
of June met overwhelming defeat at Novara. The Venetians
continued the struggle until October. On the 19th of December
the fifth Lateran council, which had been reopened by Leo in
April, ratified the peace with Louis XII. and registered the
conclusion of the Pisan schism. While the council was engaged in
planning a crusade and in considering the reform of the clergy, a
new crisis occurred between the pope and the king of France.
Francis I., who succeeded Louis XII. on the 1st of January 1515,
was an enthusiastic young prince, dominated by the ambition of
recovering Milan and Naples. Leo at once formed a new league
with the emperor and the king of Spain, and to ensure English
support made Wolsey a cardinal. Francis entered Italy in
August and on the 14th of September won the battle of Marignano.
The pope in October signed an agreement binding him to withdraw
his troops from Parma and Piacenza, which had been
previously gained at the expense of the duchy of Milan, on condition
of French protection at Rome and Florence. The king of
Spain wrote to his ambassador at Rome &ldquo;that His Holiness had
hitherto played a double game and that all his zeal to drive the
French from Italy had been only a mask&rdquo;; this reproach seemed
to receive some confirmation when Leo X. held a secret conference
with Francis at Bologna in December 1515. The ostensible subjects
under consideration were the establishment of peace
between France, Venice and the Empire, with a view to an
expedition against the Turks, and the ecclesiastical affairs of
France. Precisely what was arranged is unknown. During
these two or three years of incessant political intrigue and
warfare it was not to be expected that the Lateran council
should accomplish much. Its three main objects, the peace of
Christendom, the crusade and the reform of the church, could
be secured only by general agreement among the powers, and Leo
or the council failed to secure such agreement. Its most important
achievements were the registration at its eleventh sitting
(19th December 1516) of the abolition of the pragmatic sanction,
which the popes since Pius II. had unanimously condemned,
and the confirmation of the concordat between Leo X. and
Francis I., which was destined to regulate the relations between
the French Church and the Holy See until the Revolution.
Leo closed the council on the 16th of March 1517. It had
ended the schism, ratified the censorship of books introduced
by Alexander VI. and imposed tithes for a war against the Turks.
It raised no voice against the primacy of the pope.</p>

<p>The year which marked the close of the Lateran council was
also signalized by Leo&rsquo;s unholy war against the duke of Urbino.
The pope was naturally proud of his family and had practised
nepotism from the outset. His cousin Giulio, who subsequently
became Clement VII., he had made the most influential man in
the curia, naming him archbishop of Florence, cardinal and
vice-chancellor of the Holy See. Leo had intended his younger
brother Giuliano and his nephew Lorenzo for brilliant secular
careers. He had named them Roman patricians; the latter
he had placed in charge of Florence; the former, for whom he
planned to carve out a kingdom in central Italy of Parma,
Piacenza, Ferrara and Urbino, he had taken with himself to
Rome and married to Filiberta of Savoy. The death of Giuliano
in March 1516, however, caused the pope to transfer his ambitions
to Lorenzo. At the very time (December 1516) that peace
between France, Spain, Venice and the Empire seemed to give
some promise of a Christendom united against the Turk, Leo
was preparing an enterprise as unscrupulous as any of the
similar exploits of Cesare Borgia. He obtained 150,000 ducats
towards the expenses of the expedition from Henry VIII. of
England, in return for which he entered the imperial league of
Spain and England against France. The war lasted from
February to September 1517 and ended with the expulsion of the
duke and the triumph of Lorenzo; but it revived the nefarious
policy of Alexander VI., increased brigandage and anarchy in
the States of the Church, hindered the preparations for a crusade
and wrecked the papal finances. Guicciardini reckoned the cost
of the war to Leo at the prodigious sum of 800,000 ducats.
The new duke of Urbino was the Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici to whom
Machiavelli addressed <i>The Prince</i>. His marriage in March
1518 was arranged by the pope with Madeleine la Tour
d&rsquo;Auvergne, a royal princess of France, whose daughter was the
Catherine de&rsquo; Medici celebrated in French history. The war
of Urbino was further marked by a crisis in the relations between
pope and cardinals. The sacred college had grown especially
worldly and troublesome since the time of Sixtus IV., and Leo
took advantage of a plot of several of its members to poison him,
not only to inflict exemplary punishments by executing one and
imprisoning several others, but also to make a radical change in
the college. On the 3rd of July 1517 he published the names of
thirty-one new cardinals, a number almost unprecedented in
the history of the papacy. Some of the nominations were excellent,
such as Lorenzo Campeggio, Giambattista Pallavicini,
Adrian of Utrecht, Cajetan, Cristoforo Numai and Egidio Canisio.
The naming of seven members of prominent Roman families,
however, reversed the wise policy of his predecessor which had
kept the dangerous factions of the city out of the curia. Other
promotions were for political or family considerations or to secure
money for the war against Urbino. The pope was accused of
having exaggerated the conspiracy of the cardinals for purposes
of financial gain, but most of such accusations appear to be
unsubstantiated.</p>

<p>Leo, meanwhile, felt the need of staying the advance of the
warlike sultan, Selim I., who was threatening western Europe,
and made elaborate plans for a crusade. A truce was to be
proclaimed throughout Christendom; the pope was to be the
arbiter of disputes; the emperor and the king of France were
to lead the army; England, Spain and Portugal were to furnish
the fleet; and the combined forces were to be directed against
Constantinople. Papal diplomacy in the interests of peace
failed, however; Cardinal Wolsey made England, not the pope,
the arbiter between France and the Empire; and much of the
money collected for the crusade from tithes and indulgences
was spent in other ways. In 1519 Hungary concluded a three
years&rsquo; truce with Selim I., but the succeeding sultan, Suliman
the Magnificent, renewed the war in June 1521 and on the 28th
of August captured the citadel of Belgrade. The pope was
greatly alarmed, and although he was then involved in war
with France he sent about 30,000 ducats to the Hungarians.
Leo treated the Uniate Greeks with great loyalty, and by bull
of the 18th of May 1521 forbade Latin clergy to celebrate mass
in Greek churches and Latin bishops to ordain Greek clergy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>
These provisions were later strengthened by Clement VII. and
Paul III. and went far to settle the chronic disputes between
the Latins and Uniate Greeks.</p>

<p>Leo was disturbed throughout his pontificate by heresy and
schism. The dispute between Reuchlin and Pfefferkorn relative
to the Talmud and other Jewish books was referred to the pope
in September 1513. He in turn referred it to the bishops of
Spires and Worms, who gave decision in March 1514 in favour
of Reuchlin. After the appeal of the inquisitor-general, Hochstraten,
and the appearance of the <i>Epistolae obscurorum virorum</i>,
however, Leo annulled the decision (June 1520) and imposed
silence on Reuchlin. The pope had already authorized the
extensive grant of indulgences in order to secure funds for the
crusade and more particularly for the rebuilding of St Peter&rsquo;s
at Rome. Against the attendant abuses the Augustinian monk
Martin Luther (<i>q.v.</i>) posted (31st October 1517) on the church
door at Wittenberg his famous ninety-five theses, which were
the signal for widespread revolt against the church. Although
Leo did not fully comprehend the import of the movement, he
directed (3rd February 1518) the vicar-general of the Augustinians
to impose silence on the monks. On the 30th of May Luther
sent an explanation of his theses to the pope; on the 7th of
August he was cited to appear at Rome. An arrangement was
effected, however, whereby that citation was cancelled, and
Luther betook himself in October 1518 to Augsburg to meet the
papal legate, Cardinal Cajetan, who was attending the imperial
diet convened by the emperor Maximilian to impose the tithes
for the Turkish war and to elect a king of the Romans; but
neither the arguments of the learned cardinal, nor the dogmatic
papal bull of the 9th of November to the effect that all Christians
must believe in the pope&rsquo;s power to grant indulgences, moved
Luther to retract. A year of fruitless negotiation followed,
during which the pamphlets of the reformer set all Germany
on fire. A papal bull of the 15th of June 1520, which condemned
forty-one propositions extracted from Luther&rsquo;s teachings, was
taken to Germany by Eck in his capacity of apostolic nuncio,
published by him and the legates Alexander and Caracciola, and
burned by Luther on the 10th of December at Wittenberg. Leo
then formally excommunicated Luther by bull of the 3rd of
January 1521; and in a brief directed the emperor to take
energetic measures against heresy. On the 26th of May 1521
the emperor signed the edict of the diet of Worms, which placed
Luther under the ban of the Empire; on the 21st of the same
month Henry VIII. of England sent to Leo his book against
Luther on the seven sacraments. The pope, after careful
consideration, conferred on the king of England the title
&ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo; by bull of the 11th of October 1521.
Neither the imperial edict nor the work of Henry VIII. stayed
the Lutheran movement, and Luther himself, safe in the solitude
of the Wartburg, survived Leo X. It was under Leo X. also
that the Protestant movement had its beginning in Scandinavia.
The pope had repeatedly used the rich northern benefices to
reward members of the Roman curia, and towards the close of
the year 1516 he sent the grasping and impolitic Arcimboldi
as papal nuncio to Denmark to collect money for St Peter&rsquo;s.
King Christian II. took advantage of the growing dissatisfaction
on the part of the native clergy toward the papal government,
and of Arcimboldi&rsquo;s interference in the Swedish revolt, in order
to expel the nuncio and summon (1520) Lutheran theologians
to Copenhagen. Christian approved a plan by which a formal
state church should be established in Denmark, all appeals to
Rome should be abolished, and the king and diet should have
final jurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes. Leo sent a new nuncio
to Copenhagen (1521) in the person of the Minorite Francesco
de Potentia, who readily absolved the king and received the
rich bishopric of Skara. The pope or his legate, however, took
no steps to remove abuses or otherwise reform the Scandinavian
churches.</p>

<p>That Leo did not do more to check the tendency toward
heresy and schism in Germany and Scandinavia is to be partially
explained by the political complications of the time, and by
his own preoccupation with schemes of papal and Medicean
aggrandizement in Italy. The death of the emperor Maximilian
on the 12th of January 1519 had seriously affected the situation.
Leo vacillated between the powerful candidates for the succession,
allowing it to appear at first that he favoured Francis I. while
really working for the election of some minor German prince.
He finally accepted Charles I. of Spain as inevitable, and the
election of Charles (28th of June 1519) revealed Leo&rsquo;s desertion
of his French alliance, a step facilitated by the death at about
the same time of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici and his French wife. Leo
was now anxious to unite Ferrara, Parma and Piacenza to the
States of the Church. An attempt late in 1519 to seize Ferrara
failed, and the pope recognized the need of foreign aid. In May
1521 a treaty of alliance was signed at Rome between him
and the emperor. Milan and Genoa were to be taken from
France and restored to the Empire, and Parma and Piacenza
were to be given to the Church on the expulsion of the French.
The expense of enlisting 10,000 Swiss was to be borne equally
by pope and emperor. Charles took Florence and the Medici
family under his protection and promised to punish all enemies
of the Catholic faith. Leo agreed to invest Charles with Naples,
to crown him emperor, and to aid in a war against Venice. It
was provided that England and the Swiss might join the league.
Henry VIII. announced his adherence in August. Francis I.
had already begun war with Charles in Navarre, and in Italy,
too, the French made the first hostile movement (23rd June 1521).
Leo at once announced that he would excommunicate the king
of France and release his subjects from their allegiance unless
Francis laid down his arms and surrendered Parma and Piacenza.
The pope lived to hear the joyful news of the capture of Milan
from the French and of the occupation by papal troops of the
long-coveted provinces (November 1521). Leo X. died on the
1st of December 1521, so suddenly that the last sacraments
could not be administered; but the contemporary suspicions
of poison were unfounded. His successor was Adrian VI.</p>

<p>Several minor events of Leo&rsquo;s pontificate are worthy of mention.
He was particularly friendly with King Emmanuel of Portugal
on account of the latter&rsquo;s missionary enterprises in Asia and
Africa. His concordat with Florence (1516) guaranteed the
free election of the clergy in that city. His constitution of the
1st of March 1519 condemned the king of Spain&rsquo;s claim to refuse
the publication of papal bulls. He maintained close relations
with Poland because of the Turkish advance and the Polish
contest with the Teutonic Knights. His bull of the 1st of July
1519, which regulated the discipline of the Polish Church, was
later transformed into a concordat by Clement VII. Leo
showed special favours to the Jews and permitted them to erect
a Hebrew printing-press at Rome. He approved the formation
of the Oratory of Divine Love, a group of pious men at Rome
which later became the Theatine Order, and he canonized
Francesco di Paola.</p>

<p>As patron of learning Leo X. deserves a prominent place among
the popes. He raised the church to a high rank as the friend of
whatever seemed to extend knowledge or to refine and embellish
life. He made the capital of Christendom the centre of culture.
Every Italian artist and man of letters in an age of singular
intellectual brilliancy tasted or hoped to taste of his bounty,
while yet a cardinal, he had restored the church of Sta Maria in
Domnica after Raphael&rsquo;s designs; and as pope he built S.
Giovanni on the Via Giulia after designs by Jacopo Sansovino
and pressed forward the work on St Peter&rsquo;s and the Vatican
under Raphael and Chigi. His constitution of the 5th of
November 1513 reformed the Roman university, which had
been neglected by Julius II. He restored all its faculties, gave
larger salaries to the professors, and summoned distinguished
teachers from afar; and, although it never attained to the
importance of Padua or Bologna, it nevertheless possessed in
1514 an excellent faculty of eighty-eight professors. Leo called
Theodore Lascaris to Rome to give instruction in Greek, and
established a Greek printing-press from which the first Greek
book printed at Rome appeared in 1515. He made Raphael
custodian of the classical antiquities of Rome and the vicinity.
The distinguished Latinists Pietro Bembo (1470-1547) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>
Jacopo Sadoleto (1477-1547) were papal secretaries, as well as
the famous poet Bernardo Accolti (d. 1534). Writers of poetry
like Vida (1490-1566), Trissino (1478-1550), and Bibbiena (1470-1520),
writers of <i>novelle</i> like Bandello, and a hundred other
<i>literati</i> of the time were bishops, or papal scriptors or abbreviators,
or in other papal employ. Leo&rsquo;s lively interest in art and
literature, to say nothing of his natural liberality, his nepotism,
his political ambitions and necessities, and his immoderate
personal luxury, exhausted within two years the hard savings of
Julius II., and precipitated a financial crisis from which he never
emerged and which was a direct cause of most of the calamities
of his pontificate. He created many new offices and shamelessly
sold them. He sold cardinals&rsquo; hats. He sold membership in
the &ldquo;Knights of Peter.&rdquo; He borrowed large sums from bankers,
curials, princes and Jews. The Venetian ambassador Gradenigo
estimated the paying number of offices on Leo&rsquo;s death at 2150,
with a capital value of nearly 3,000,000 ducats and a yearly
income of 328,000 ducats. Marino Giorgi reckoned the ordinary
income of the pope for the year 1517 at about 580,000 ducats,
of which 420,000 came from the States of the Church, 100,000
from annates, and 60,000 from the composition tax instituted by
Sixtus IV. These sums, together with the considerable amounts
accruing from indulgences, jubilees, and special fees, vanished
as quickly as they were received. Then the pope resorted to
pawning palace furniture, table plate, jewels, even statues of the
apostles. Several banking firms and many individual creditors
were ruined by the death of the pope.</p>

<p>In the past many conflicting estimates were made of the
character and achievements of the pope during whose pontificate
Protestantism first took form. More recent studies have served
to produce a fairer and more honest opinion of Leo X. A
report of the Venetian ambassador Marino Giorgi bearing date of
March 1517 indicates some of his predominant characteristics:&mdash;&ldquo;The
pope is a good-natured and extremely free-hearted man,
who avoids every difficult situation and above all wants peace;
he would not undertake a war himself unless his own personal
interests were involved; he loves learning; of canon law and
literature he possesses remarkable knowledge; he is, moreover,
a very excellent musician.&rdquo; Leo was dignified in appearance
and elegant in speech, manners and writing. He enjoyed music
and the theatre, art and poetry, the masterpieces of the ancients
and the wonderful creations of his contemporaries, the spiritual
and the witty&mdash;life in every form. It is by no means certain that
he made the remark often attributed to him, &ldquo;Let us enjoy the
papacy since God has given it to us,&rdquo; but there is little doubt
that he was by nature devoid of moral earnestness or deep
religious feeling. On the other hand, in spite of his worldliness,
Leo was not an unbeliever; he prayed, fasted, and participated
in the services of the church with conscientiousness. To the
virtues of liberality, charity and clemency he added the Machiavellian
qualities of falsehood and shrewdness, so highly esteemed
by the princes of his time. Leo was deemed fortunate by his
contemporaries, but an incurable malady, wars, enemies, a
conspiracy of cardinals, and the loss of all his nearest relations
darkened his days; and he failed entirely in his general policy
of expelling foreigners from Italy, of restoring peace throughout
Europe, and of prosecuting war against the Turks. He failed
to recognize the pressing need of reform within the church and
the tremendous dangers which threatened the papal monarchy;
and he unpardonably neglected the spiritual needs of the time.
He was, however, zealous in firmly establishing the political
power of the Holy See; he made it unquestionably supreme in
Italy; he successfully restored the papal power in France;
and he secured a prominent place in the history of culture.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo XII.</span> (Annibale della Genga), pope from 1823 to 1829,
was born of a noble family, near Spoleto, on the 22nd of August
1760. Educated at the Accademia dei Nobili ecclesiastici at
Rome, he was ordained priest in 1783, and in 1790 attracted
favourable attention by a tactful sermon commemorative of the
emperor Joseph II. In 1792 Pius VI. made him his private
secretary, in 1793 creating him titular archbishop of Tyre and
despatching him to Lucerne as nuncio. In 1794 he was transferred
to the nunciature at Cologne, but owing to the war had to
make his residence in Augsburg. During the dozen or more years
he spent in Germany he was entrusted with several honourable
and difficult missions, which brought him into contact with the
courts of Dresden, Vienna, Munich and Württemberg, as well
as with Napoleon. It is, however, charged at one time during
this period that his finances were disordered, and his private life
not above suspicion. After the abolition of the States of the
Church, he was treated by the French as a state prisoner, and
lived for some years at the abbey of Monticelli, solacing himself
with music and with bird-shooting, pastimes which he did not
eschew even after his election as pope. In 1814 he was chosen
to carry the pope&rsquo;s congratulations to Louis XVIII.; in 1816
he was created cardinal-priest of Santa Maria Maggiore, and
appointed to the see of Sinigaglia, which he resigned in 1818.
In 1820 Pius VII. gave him the distinguished post of cardinal
vicar. In the conclave of 1823, in spite of the active opposition
of France, he was elected pope by the <i>zelanti</i> on the 28th of
September. His election had been facilitated because he was
thought to be on the edge of the grave; but he unexpectedly
rallied. His foreign policy, entrusted at first to Della Somaglia
and then to the more able Bernetti, moved in general along lines
laid down by Consalvi; and he negotiated certain concordats
very advantageous to the papacy. Personally most frugal, Leo
reduced taxes, made justice less costly, and was able to find
money for certain public improvements; yet he left the finances
more confused than he had found them, and even the elaborate
jubilee of 1825 did not really mend matters. His domestic policy
was one of extreme reaction. He condemned the Bible societies,
and under Jesuit influence reorganized the educational system.
Severe ghetto laws led many of the Jews to emigrate. He hunted
down the <i>Carbonari</i> and the Freemasons; he took the strongest
measures against political agitation in theatres. A well-nigh
ubiquitous system of espionage, perhaps most fruitful when
directed against official corruption, sapped the foundations of
public confidence. Leo, temperamentally stern, hard-working in
spite of bodily infirmity, died at Rome on the 10th of February

1829. The news was received by the populace with unconcealed
joy. He was succeeded by Pius VIII.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo XIII.</span> (Gioacchino Pecci) (1810-1903), pope from 1878 to
1903, reckoned the 257th successor of St Peter, was born at
Carpineto on the 2nd of March 1810. His family was Sienese
in origin, and his father, Colonel Domenico Pecci, had served
in the army of Napoleon. His mother, Anna Prosperi, is said
to have been a descendant of Rienzi, and was a member of the
third order of St Francis. He and his elder brother Giuseppe
(known as Cardinal Pecci) received their earliest education
from the Jesuits at Viterbo, and completed their education in
Rome. In the jubilee year 1825 he was selected by his fellow-students
at the Collegium Romanum to head a deputation
to Pope Leo XII., whose memory he subsequently cherished
and whose name he assumed in 1878. Weak health, consequent
on over-study, prevented him from obtaining the highest
academical honours, but he graduated as doctor in theology
at the age of twenty-two, and then entered the Accademia dei
Nobili ecclesiastici, a college in which clergy of aristocratic
birth are trained for the diplomatic service of the Roman Church.
Two years later Gregory XVI. appointed him a domestic prelate,
and bestowed on him, by way of apprenticeship, various minor
administrative offices. He was ordained priest on the 31st of
December 1837, and a few weeks later was made apostolic
delegate of the small papal territory of Benevento, where he
had to deal with brigands and smugglers, who enjoyed the
protection of some of the noble families of the district. His
success here led to his appointment in 1841 as delegate of Perugia,
which was at that time a centre of anti-papal secret societies.
This post he held for eighteen months only, but in that brief
period he obtained a reputation as a social and municipal reformer.
In 1843 he was sent as nuncio to Brussels, being first consecrated
a bishop (19th February), with the title of archbishop of Damietta.
During his three years&rsquo; residence at the Belgian capital he found
ample scope for his gifts as a diplomatist in the education controversy
then raging, and as mediator between the Jesuits and
the Catholic university of Louvain. He gained the esteem of
Leopold I., and was presented to Queen Victoria of England
and the Prince Consort. He also made the acquaintance of many
Englishmen, Archbishop Whately among them. In January
1846, at the request of the magistrates and people of Perugia,
he was appointed bishop of that city with the rank of archbishop;
but before returning to Italy he spent February in London, and
March and April in Paris. On his arrival in Rome he would,
at the request of King Leopold, have been created cardinal
but for the death of Gregory XVI. Seven years later, 19th
December 1853, he received the red hat from Pius IX. Meanwhile,
and throughout his long episcopate of thirty-two years,
he foreshadowed the zeal and the enlightened policy later to be
displayed in the prolonged period of his pontificate, building
and restoring many churches, striving to elevate the intellectual
as well as the spiritual tone of his clergy, and showing in his
pastoral letters an unusual regard for learning and for social
reform. His position in Italy was similar to that of Bishop
Dupanloup in France; and, as but a moderate supporter of the
policy enunciated in the Syllabus, he was not altogether <i>persona
grata</i> to Pius IX. But he protested energetically against the
loss of the pope&rsquo;s temporal power in 1870, against the confiscation
of the property of the religious orders, and against
the law of civil marriage established by the Italian government,
and he refused to welcome Victor Emmanuel in his diocese.
Nevertheless, he remained in the comparative obscurity of his
episcopal see until the death of Cardinal Antonelli; but in 1877,
when the important papal office of <i>camerlengo</i> became vacant,
Pius IX. appointed to it Cardinal Pecci, who thus returned
to reside in Rome, with the prospect of having shortly responsible
functions to perform during the vacancy of the Holy See, though
the <i>camerlengo</i> was traditionally regarded as disqualified by his
office from succeeding to the papal throne.</p>

<p>When Pius IX. died (7th February 1878) Cardinal Pecci was
elected pope at the subsequent conclave with comparative
unanimity, obtaining at the third scrutiny (20th February)
forty-four out of sixty-one votes, or more than the requisite
two-thirds majority. The conclave was remarkably free from
political influences, the attention of Europe being at the time
engrossed by the presence of a Russian army at the gates of
Constantinople. It was said that the long pontificate of Pius IX.
led some of the cardinals to vote for Pecci, since his age (within
a few days of sixty-eight) and health warranted the expectation
that his reign would be comparatively brief; but he had for
years been known as one of the few &ldquo;papable&rdquo; cardinals; and
although his long seclusion at Perugia had caused his name to
be little known outside Italy, there was a general belief that
the conclave had selected a man who was a prudent statesman
as well as a devout churchman; and Newman (whom he created
a cardinal in the year following) is reported to have said, &ldquo;In
the successor of Pius I recognize a depth of thought, a tenderness
of heart, a winning simplicity, and a power answering to the
name of Leo, which prevent me from lamenting that Pius is no
longer here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second day after his election Pope Leo XIII. crossed
the Tiber <i>incognito</i> to his former residence in the Falconieri
Palace to collect his papers, returning at once to the Vatican,
where he continued to regard himself as &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; so
long as the Italian government occupied the city of Rome.
He was crowned in the Sistine Chapel 3rd March 1878, and at
once began a reform of the papal household on austere and
economic lines which found little favour with the <i>entourage</i>
of the former pope. To fill posts near his own person he summoned
certain of the Perugian clergy who had been trained under
his own eye, and from the first he was less accessible than his
predecessor had been, either in public or private audience.
Externally uneventful as his life henceforth necessarily was,
it was marked chiefly by the reception of distinguished personages
and of numerous pilgrimages, often on a large scale, from all
parts of the world, and by the issue of encyclical letters. The
stricter theological training of the Roman Catholic clergy
throughout the world on the lines laid down by St Thomas
Aquinas was his first care, and to this end he founded in Rome
and endowed an academy bearing the great schoolman&rsquo;s name,
further devoting about £12,000 to the publication of a new and
splendid edition of his works, the idea being that on this basis
the later teaching of Catholic theologians and many of the
speculations of modern thinkers could best be harmonized and
brought into line. The study of Church history was next encouraged,
and in August 1883 the pope addressed a letter to
Cardinals de Luca, Pitra and Hergenröther, in which he made
the remarkable concession that the Vatican archives and library
might be placed at the disposal of persons qualified to compile
manuals of history. His belief was that the Church would not
suffer by the publication of documents. A man of literary taste
and culture, familiar with the classics, a facile writer of Latin
verses<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> as well as of Ciceronian prose, he was as anxious that the
Roman clergy should unite human science and literature with
their theological studies as that the laity should be educated
in the principles of religion; and to this end he established
in Rome a kind of voluntary school board, with members both
lay and clerical; and the rivalry of the schools thus founded
ultimately obliged the state to include religious teaching in its
curriculum. The numerous encyclicals by which the pontificate
of Leo XIII. will always be distinguished were prepared and
written by himself, but were submitted to the customary revision.
The encyclical <i>Aeterni Patris</i> (4th August 1879) was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>
written in the defence of the philosophy of St Thomas Aquinas.
In later ones, working on the principle that the Christian Church
should superintend and direct every form of civil life, he dealt
with the Christian constitution of states (<i>Immortale Dei</i>, 1st
November 1885), with human liberty (<i>Libertas</i>, 20th June 1888),
and with the condition of the working classes (<i>Rerum novarum</i>,
15th May 1891). This last was slightly tinged with modern
socialism; it was described as &ldquo;the social Magna Carta of
Catholicism,&rdquo; and it won for Leo the name of &ldquo;the working-man&rsquo;s
pope.&rdquo; Translated into the chief modern languages,
many thousands of copies were circulated among the working
classes in Catholic countries. Other encyclicals, such as those
on Christian marriage (<i>Arcanum divinae sapientiae</i>, 10th February
1880), on the Rosary (<i>Supremi apostolatus officii</i>, 1st September
1883, and <i>Superiore anno</i>, 5th September 1898), and on Freemasonry
(<i>Humanum genus</i>, 20th April 1884), dealt with subjects
on which his predecessor had been accustomed to pronounce
allocutions, and were on similar lines. It was the knowledge
that in all points of religious faith and practice Leo XIII. stood
precisely where Pius IX. had stood that served to render ineffectual
others of his encyclicals, in which he dealt earnestly
and effectively with matters in which orthodox Protestants had
a sympathetic interest with him and might otherwise have lent
an ear to his counsels. Such were the letters on the study of
Holy Scripture (18th November 1893), and on the reunion of
Christendom (20th June 1894). He showed special anxiety for
the return of England to the Roman Catholic fold, and addressed
a letter <i>ad Anglos</i>, dated 14th April 1895. This he followed
up by an encyclical on the unity of the Church (<i>Satis cognitum</i>,
29th June 1896); and the question of the validity of Anglican
ordinations from the Roman Catholic point of view having been
raised in Rome by Viscount Halifax, with whom the abbé
Louis Duchesne and one or two other French priests were in
sympathy, a commission was appointed to consider the subject,
and on the 15th of September 1896 a condemnation of the
Anglican form as theologically insufficient was issued, and was
directed to be taken as final.</p>

<p>The establishment of a diocesan hierarchy in Scotland had
been decided upon before the death of Pius IX., but the actual
announcement of it was made by Leo XIII. On the 25th of
July 1898 he addressed to the Scottish Catholic bishops a letter,
in the course of which he said that &ldquo;many of the Scottish
people who do not agree with us in faith sincerely love the name
of Christ and strive to ascertain His doctrine and to imitate
His most holy example.&rdquo; The Irish and American bishops
he summoned to Rome to confer with him on the subjects of
Home Rule and of &ldquo;Americanism&rdquo; respectively. In India
he established a diocesan hierarchy, with seven archbishoprics,
the archbishop of Goa taking precedence with the rank of
patriarch.</p>

<p>With the government of Italy his general policy was to be as
conciliatory as was consistent with his oath as pope never to
surrender the &ldquo;patrimony of St Peter&rdquo;; but a moderate attitude
was rendered difficult by partisans on either side in the press,
each of whom claimed to represent his views. In 1879, addressing
a congress of Catholic journalists in Rome, he exhorted them
to uphold the necessity of the temporal power, and to proclaim
to the world that the affairs of Italy would never prosper until
it was restored; in 1887 he found it necessary to deprecate
the violence with which this doctrine was advocated in certain
journals. A similar counsel of moderation was given to the
Canadian press in connexion with the Manitoba school question
in December 1897. The less conciliatory attitude towards the
Italian government was resumed in an encyclical addressed
to the Italian clergy (5th August 1898), in which he insisted
on the duty of Italian Catholics to abstain from political life
while the papacy remained in its &ldquo;painful, precarious and
intolerable position.&rdquo; And in January 1902, reversing the
policy which had its inception in the encyclical, <i>Rerum novarum</i>,
of 1891, and had further been developed ten years later in a
letter to the Italian bishops entitled <i>Graves de communi</i>, the
&ldquo;Sacred Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs&rdquo;
issued instructions concerning &ldquo;Christian Democracy in Italy,&rdquo;
directing that the popular Christian movement, which embraced
in its programme a number of social reforms, such as factory
laws for children, old-age pensions, a minimum wage in agricultural
industries, an eight-hours&rsquo; day, the revival of trade gilds,
and the encouragement of Sunday rest, should divert its attention
from all such things as savoured of novelty and devote its
energies to the restoration of the temporal power. The reactionary
policy thus indicated gave the impression that a
similar aim underlay the appointment about the same date of a
commission to inquire into Biblical studies; and in other minor
matters Leo XIII. disappointed those who had looked to him for
certain reforms in the devotional system of the Church. A
revision of the breviary, which would have involved the omission
of some of the less credible legends, came to nothing, while the
recitation of the office in honour of the Santa Casa at Loreto
was imposed on all the clergy. The worship of Mary, largely
developed during the reign of Pius IX., received further stimulus
from Leo; nor did he do anything during his pontificate to
correct the superstitions connected with popular beliefs concerning
relics and indulgences.</p>

<p>His policy towards all governments outside Italy was to
support them wherever they represented social order; and
it was with difficulty that he persuaded French Catholics to be
united in defence of the republic. The German <i>Kulturkampf</i>
was ended by his exertions. In 1885 he successfully arbitrated
between Germany and Spain in a dispute concerning the Caroline
Islands. In Ireland he condemned the &ldquo;Plan of Campaign&rdquo;
in 1888, but he conciliated the Nationalists by appointing
Dr Walsh archbishop of Dublin. His hope that his support
of the British government in Ireland would be followed by the
establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the court
of St James&rsquo;s and the Vatican was disappointed. But the
jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887 and the pope&rsquo;s priestly jubilee
a few months later were the occasion of friendly intercourse
between Rome and Windsor, Mgr. Ruffo Scilla coming to London
as special papal envoy, and the duke of Norfolk being received
at the Vatican as the bearer of the congratulations of the queen
of England. Similar courtesies were exchanged during the
jubilee of 1897, and again in March 1902, when Edward VII.
sent the earl of Denbigh to Rome to congratulate Leo XIII.
on reaching his ninety-third year and the twenty-fifth year of
his pontificate. The visit of Edward VII. to Leo XIII. in April
1903 was a further proof of the friendliness between the English
court and the Vatican.</p>

<p>The elevation of Newman to the college of Cardinals in 1879
was regarded with approval throughout the English-speaking
world, both on Newman&rsquo;s account and also as evidence that
Leo XIII. had a wider horizon than his predecessor; and his
similar recognition of two of the most distinguished &ldquo;inopportunist&rdquo;
members of the Vatican council, Haynald, archbishop
of Kalocsa, and Prince Fürstenberg, archbishop of Olmütz, was
even more noteworthy. Dupanloup would doubtless have
received the same honour had he not died shortly after Leo&rsquo;s
accession. Döllinger the pope attempted to reconcile, but failed.
He laboured much to bring about the reunion of the Oriental
Churches with the see of Rome, establishing Catholic educational
centres in Athens and in Constantinople with that end in view.
He used his influence with the emperor of Russia, as also with
the emperors of China and Japan and with the shah of Persia,
to secure the free practice of their religion for Roman Catholics
within their respective dominions. Among the canonizations
and beatifications of his pontificate that of Sir Thomas More,
author of <i>Utopia</i>, is memorable. His encyclical issued at Easter
1902, and described by himself as a kind of will, was mainly a
reiteration of earlier condemnations of the Reformation, and of
modern philosophical systems, which for their atheism and
materialism he makes responsible for all existing moral and
political disorders. Society, he earnestly pleaded, can only find
salvation by a return to Christianity and to the fold of the Roman
Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Grave and serious in manner, speaking slowly, but with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span>
energetic gestures, simple and abstemious in his life&mdash;his daily
bill of fare being reckoned as hardly costing a couple of francs&mdash;Leo
XIII. distributed large sums in charity, and at his own
charges placed costly astronomical instruments in the Vatican
observatory, providing also accommodation and endowment
for a staff of officials. He always showed the greatest interest
in science and in literature, and he would have taken a position
as a statesman of the first rank had he held office in any secular
government. He may be reckoned the most illustrious pope
since Benedict XIV., and under him the papacy acquired a
prestige unknown since the middle ages. On the 3rd of March
1903 he celebrated his jubilee in St Peter&rsquo;s with more than usual
pomp and splendour; he died on the 20th of July following.
His successor was Pius X.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEO,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> the name of six emperors of the East.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo I.</span>, variously surnamed <span class="sc">Thrax</span>, <span class="sc">Magnus</span> and <span class="sc">Makelles</span>,
emperor of the East, 457-474, was born in Thrace about 400.
From his position as military tribune he was raised to the throne
by the soldiery and recognized both by senate and clergy; his
coronation by the patriarch of Constantinople is said to have
been the earliest instance of such a ceremony. Leo owed his
elevation mainly to Aspar, the commander of the guards, who
was debarred by his Arianism from becoming emperor in his own
person, but hoped to exercise a virtual autocracy through his
former steward and dependant. But Leo, following the traditions
of his predecessor Marcian, set himself to curtail the domination
of the great nobles and repeatedly acted in defiance of Aspar.
Thus he vigorously suppressed the Eutychian heresy in Egypt,
and by exchanging his Germanic bodyguard for Isaurians
removed the chief basis of Aspar&rsquo;s power. With the help of
his generals Anthemius and Anagastus, he repelled invasions
of the Huns into Dacia (466 and 468). In 467 Leo had Anthemius
elected emperor of the West, and in concert with him equipped
an armament of more than 1100 ships and 100,000 men against
the pirate empire of the Vandals in Africa. Through the remissness
of Leo&rsquo;s brother-in-law Basiliscus, who commanded the
expedition, the fleet was surprised by the Vandal king, Genseric,
and half of its vessels sunk or burnt (468). This failure was made
a pretext by Leo for killing Aspar as a traitor (471), and Aspar&rsquo;s
murder served the Goths in turn as an excuse for ravaging
Thrace up to the walls of the capital. In 473 the emperor
associated with himself his infant grandson, <span class="sc">Leo II.</span>, who, however,
survived him by only a few months. His surnames Magnus
(Great) and Makelles (butcher) respectively reflect the attitude
of the Orthodox and the Arians towards his religious policy.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="sc">Leo III.</span> (<i>c.</i> 680-740), surnamed <span class="sc">The Isaurian</span>, emperor of
the East, 717-740. Born about 680 in the Syrian province of
Commagene, he rose to distinction in the military service, and
under Anastasius II. was invested with the command of the
eastern army. In 717 he revolted against the usurper Theodosius
III. and, marching upon Constantinople, was elected emperor
in his stead. The first year of Leo&rsquo;s reign saw a memorable siege
of his capital by the Saracens, who had taken advantage of the
civil discord in the Roman empire to bring up a force of 80,000
men to the Bosporus. By his stubborn defence the new ruler
wore out the invaders who, after a twelve months&rsquo; investment,
withdrew their forces. An important factor in the victory of the
Romans was their use of Greek fire. Having thus preserved the
empire from extinction, Leo proceeded to consolidate its administration,
which in the previous years of anarchy had become completely
disorganized. He secured its frontiers by inviting Slavonic
settlers into the depopulated districts and by restoring the army
to efficiency; when the Arabs renewed their invasions in 726
and 739 they were decisively beaten. His civil reforms include
the abolition of the system of prepaying taxes which had weighed
heavily upon the wealthier proprietors, the elevation of the serfs
into a class of free tenants, the remodelling of family and of
maritime law. These measures, which were embodied in a new
code published in 740, met with some opposition on the part of
the nobles and higher clergy. But Leo&rsquo;s most striking legislative
reforms dealt with religious matters. After an apparently
successful attempt to enforce the baptism of all Jews and
Montanists in his realm (722), he issued a series of edicts against
the worship of images (726-729). This prohibition of a custom
which had undoubtedly given rise to grave abuses seems to have
been inspired by a genuine desire to improve public morality,
and received the support of the official aristocracy and a section
of the clergy. But a majority of the theologians and all the
monks opposed these measures with uncompromising hostility,
and in the western parts of the empire the people refused to obey
the edict. A revolt which broke out in Greece, mainly on religious
grounds, was crushed by the imperial fleet (727), and
two years later, by deposing the patriarch of Constantinople,
Leo suppressed the overt opposition of the capital. In Italy the
defiant attitude of Popes Gregory II. and III. on behalf of image-worship
led to a fierce quarrel with the emperor. The former
summoned councils in Rome to anathematize and excommunicate
the image-breakers (730, 732); Leo retaliated by
transferring southern Italy and Greece from the papal diocese to
that of the patriarch. The struggle was accompanied by an
armed outbreak in the exarchate of Ravenna (727), which Leo
finally endeavoured to subdue by means of a large fleet. But the
destruction of the armament by a storm decided the issue against
him; his south Italian subjects successfully defied his religious
edicts, and the province of Ravenna became detached from the
empire. In spite of this partial failure Leo must be reckoned
as one of the greatest of the later Roman emperors. By his resolute
stand against the Saracens he delivered all eastern Europe
from a great danger, and by his thorough-going reforms he not
only saved the empire from collapse, but invested it with a
stability which enabled it to survive all further shocks for a space
of five centuries.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo IV.</span>, called <span class="sc">Chozar</span>, succeeded his father, Constantine V.,
as emperor of the East in 775. In 776 he associated his young
son, Constantine, with himself in the empire, and suppressed a
rising led by his five step-brothers which broke out as a result
of this proceeding. Leo was largely under the influence of his
wife Irene (<i>q.v.</i>), and when he died in 780 he left her as the
guardian of his successor, Constantine VI.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo V.</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">The Armenian</span>, emperor of the East, 813-820,
was a distinguished general of Nicephorus I. and Michael I.
After rendering good service on behalf of the latter in a war with
the Arabs (812), he was summoned in 813 to co-operate in a
campaign against the Bulgarians. Taking advantage of the disaffection
prevalent among the troops, he left Michael in the lurch
at the battle of Adrianople and subsequently led a successful
revolution against him. Leo justified his usurpation by repeatedly
defeating the Bulgarians who had been contemplating
the siege of Constantinople (814-817). By his vigorous measures
of repression against the Paulicians and image-worshippers
he roused considerable opposition, and after a conspiracy under
his friend Michael Psellus had been foiled by the imprisonment
of its leader, he was assassinated in the palace chapel on
Christmas Eve, 820.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leo VI.</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">The Wise</span> and <span class="sc">The Philosopher</span>, Byzantine
emperor, 886-911. He was a weak-minded ruler, chiefly
occupied with unimportant wars with barbarians and struggles
with churchmen. The chief event of his reign was the capture
of Thessalonica (904) by Mahommedan pirates (described in
<i>The Capture of Thessalonica</i> by John Cameniata) under the
renegade Leo of Tripolis. In Sicily and Lower Italy the imperial
arms were unsuccessful, and the Bulgarian Symeon, who assumed
the title of &ldquo;Czar of the Bulgarians and autocrat of the Romaei&rdquo;
secured the independence of his church by the establishment
of a patriarchate. Leo&rsquo;s somewhat absurd surname may be
explained by the facts that he &ldquo;was less ignorant than the greater
part of his contemporaries in church and state, that his education
had been directed by the learned Photius, and that several
books of profane and ecclesiastical science were composed by the
pen, or in the name, of the imperial philosopher&rdquo; (Gibbon).
His works include seventeen <i>Oracula</i>, in iambic verse, on the
destinies of future emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople;
thirty-three <i>Orations</i>, chiefly on theological subjects (such as
church festivals); <i>Basilica</i>, the completion of the digest of the
laws of Justinian, begun by Basil I., the father of Leo; some
epigrams in the Greek <i>Anthology</i>; an iambic lament on the
melancholy condition of the empire; and some palindromic
verses, curiously called <span class="grk" title="karkinoi">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> (crabs). The treatise on military
tactics, attributed to him, is probably by Leo III., the Isaurian.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEO,<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> <span class="sc">Brother</span> (d. <i>c.</i> 1270), the favourite disciple, secretary and
confessor of St Francis of Assisi. The dates of his birth and of his
becoming a Franciscan are not known; but he was one of the
small group of most trusted companions of the saint during his
last years. After Francis&rsquo;s death Leo took a leading part in the
opposition to Elias: he it was who broke in pieces the marble
box which Elias had set up for offertories for the completion of
the basilica at Assisi. For this Elias had him scourged, and this
outrage on St Francis&rsquo;s dearest disciple consolidated the opposition
to Elias and brought about his deposition. Leo was the
leader in the early stages of the struggle in the order for the
maintenance of St Francis&rsquo;s ideas on strict poverty, and the chief
inspirer of the tradition of the Spirituals on St Francis&rsquo;s life
and teaching. The claim that he wrote the so-called <i>Speculum
perfectionis</i> cannot be allowed, but portions of it no doubt go
back to him. A little volume of his writings has been published
by Lemmeus (<i>Scripta Iratris Leonis</i>, 1901). Leo assisted at
St Clara&rsquo;s death-bed, 1253; after suffering many persecutions
from the dominant party in the order he died at the Portiuncula
in extreme old age.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEO, HEINRICH<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1799-1878), German historian, was born
at Rudolstadt on the 19th of March 1799, his father being
chaplain to the garrison there. His family, not of Italian origin&mdash;as
he himself was inclined to believe on the strength of family
tradition&mdash;but established in Lower Saxony so early as the
16th century, was typical of the German upper middle classes,
and this fact, together with the strongly religious atmosphere
in which he was brought up and his early enthusiasm for nature,
largely determined the bent of his mind. The taste for historical
study was, moreover, early instilled into him by the eminent
philologist Karl Wilhelm Göttling (1793-1869), who in 1816
became a master at the Rudolstadt gymnasium. From 1816
to 1819 Leo studied at the universities of Breslau, Jena and
Göttingen, devoting himself more especially to history, philology
and theology. At this time the universities were still agitated
by the Liberal and patriotic aspirations aroused by the War of
Liberation; at Breslau Leo fell under the influence of Jahn, and
joined the political gymnastic association (<i>Turnverein</i>); at Jena
he attached himself to the radical wing of the German <i>Burschenschaft</i>,
the so-called &ldquo;Black Band,&rdquo; under the leadership of Karl
Follen. The murder of Kotzebue by Karl Sand, however,
shocked him out of his extreme revolutionary views, and from
this time he tended, under the influence of the writings of Hamann
and Herder, more and more in the direction of conservatism
and romanticism, until at last he ended, in a mood almost of
pessimism, by attaching himself to the extreme right wing of the
forces of reaction. So early as April 1819, at Göttingen, he had
fallen under the influence of Karl Ludwig von Haller&rsquo;s <i>Handbuch
der allgemeinen Staatenkunde</i> (1808), a text-book of the counter-Revolution.
On the 11th of May 1820 he took his doctor&rsquo;s
degree; in the same year he qualified as <i>Privatdozent</i> at the
university of Erlangen. For this latter purpose he had chosen
as his thesis the constitution of the free Lombard cities in the
middle ages, the province in which he was destined to do most
for the scientific study of history. His interest in it was greatly
stimulated by a journey to Italy in 1823; in 1824 he returned
to the subject, and, as the result, published in five volumes a
history of the Italian states (1829-1832). Meanwhile he had
been established (1822-1827) as <i>Dozent</i> at Berlin, where he came
in contact with the leaders of German thought and was somewhat
spoilt by the flattering attentions of the highest Prussian society.
Here, too, it was that Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy of history made a deep
impression upon him. It was at Halle, however, where he
remained for forty years (1828-1868), that he acquired his fame
as an academical teacher. His wonderful power of exposition,
aided by a remarkable memory, is attested by the most various
witnesses. In 1830 he became ordinary professor.</p>

<p>In addition to his lecturing, Leo found time for much literary
and political work. He collaborated in the <i>Jahrbücher für
Wissenschaftliche Kritik</i> from its foundation in 1827 until the
publication was stopped in 1846. As a critic of independent
views he won the approval of Goethe; on the other hand, he
fell into violent controversy with Ranke about questions connected
with Italian history. Up to the revolutionary year 1830
his religious views had remained strongly tinged with rationalism,
Hegel remaining his guide in religion as in practical politics
and the treatment of history. It was not till 1838 that Leo&rsquo;s
polemical work <i>Die Hegelingen</i> proclaimed his breach with the
radical developments of the philosopher&rsquo;s later disciples; a
breach which developed into opposition to the philosopher himself.
Under the impression of the July revolution in Paris and
of the orthodox and pietistic influences at Halle, Leo&rsquo;s political
convictions were henceforth dominated by reactionary principles.
As a friend of the Prussian &ldquo;Camarilla&rdquo; and of King Frederick
William IV. he collaborated especially in the high conservative
<i>Politisches Wochenblatt</i>, which first appeared in 1831, as well as
in the <i>Evangelische Kirchenzeitung</i>, the <i>Kreuzzeitung</i> and the
<i>Volksblatt für Stadt und Land</i>. In all this his critics scented an
inclination towards Catholicism; and Leo did actually glorify
the counter-Reformation, <i>e.g.</i> in his <i>History of the Netherlands</i>
(2 vols. 1832-1835). His other historical works also, notably
his <i>Universalgeschichte</i> (6 vols., 1835-1844), display a very one-sided
point of view. When, however, in connexion with the
quarrel about the archbishopric of Cologne (1837), political
Catholicism raised its head menacingly, Leo turned against it
with extreme violence in his open letter (1838) to Goerres, its
foremost champion. On the other hand, he took a lively part in
the politico-religious controversies within the fold of Prussian
Protestantism.</p>

<p>Leo was by nature highly excitable and almost insanely
passionate, though at the same time strictly honourable, unselfish,
and in private intercourse even gentle. During the last year of
his life his mind suffered rapid decay, of which signs had been
apparent so early as 1868. He died at Halle on the 24th of April
1878. In addition to the works already mentioned, he left behind
an account of his early life (<i>Meine Jugendzeit</i>, Gotha, 1880)
which is of interest.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEO, JOHANNES<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1494-1552), in Italian <span class="sc">Giovanni Leo</span> or
<span class="sc">Leone</span>, usually called <span class="sc">Leo Africanus</span>, sometimes <span class="sc">Eliberitanus</span>
(<i>i.e.</i> of Granada), and properly known among the Moors
as Al Hassan Ibn Mahommed Al Wezaz Al Fasi, was the author
of a <i>Descrizione dell&rsquo; Affrica</i>, or <i>Africae descriptio</i>, which long
ranked as the best authority on Mahommedan Africa. Born
probably at Granada of a noble Moorish stock (his father was a
landowner; an uncle of his appears as an envoy from Fez to
Timbuktu), he received a great part of his education at Fez,
and while still very young began to travel widely in the Barbary
States. In 1512 we trace him at Morocco, Tunis, Bugia and
Constantine; in 1513 we find him returning from Tunis to
Morocco; and before the close of the latter year he seems to have
started on his famous Sudan and Sahara journeys (1513-1515)
which brought him to Timbuktu, to many other regions of the
Great Desert and the Niger basin (Guinea, Melli, Gago, Walata,
Aghadez, Wangara, Katsena, &amp;c.), and apparently to Bornu
and Lake Chad. In 1516-1517 he travelled to Constantinople,
probably visiting Egypt on the way; it is more uncertain when
he visited the three Arabias (<i>Deserta</i>, <i>Felix</i> and <i>Petraea</i>),
Armenia and &ldquo;Tartary&rdquo; (the last term is perhaps satisfied by
his stay at Tabriz). His three Egyptian journeys, immediately
after the Turkish conquest, all probably fell between 1517 and
1520; on one of these he ascended the Nile from Cairo to Assuan.
As he was returning from Egypt about 1520 he was captured by
pirates near the island of Gerba, and was ultimately presented as
a slave to Leo X. The pope discovered his merit, assigned him
a pension, and having persuaded him to profess the Christian
faith, stood sponsor at his baptism, and bestowed on him (as
Ramusio says) his own names, Johannes and Leo. The new
convert, having made himself acquainted with Latin and Italian,
taught Arabic (among his pupils was Cardinal Egidio Antonini,
bishop of Viterbo); he also wrote books in both the Christian
tongues he had acquired. His <i>Description of Africa</i> was first,
apparently, written in Arabic, but the primary text now remaining
is that of the Italian version, issued by the author at Rome,
on the 10th of March 1526, three years after Pope Leo&rsquo;s death,
though originally undertaken at the latter&rsquo;s suggestion. The
Moor seems to have lived on Rome for some time longer, but
he returned to Africa some time before his death at Tunis in
1552; according to some, he renounced his Christianity and
returned to Islam; but the later part of his career is obscure.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Descrizione dell&rsquo; Affrica</i> in its original Arabic MS. is said to
have existed for some time in the library of Vincenzo Pinelli (1535-1601);
the Italian text, though issued in 1526, was first printed by
Giovanni Battista Ramusio in his <i>Navigationi et Viaggi</i> (vol. i.) of
1550. This was reprinted in 1554, 1563, 1588, &amp;c. In 1556 Jean
Temporal executed at Lyons an admirable French version from the
Italian (<i>Historiale description de l&rsquo;Afrique</i>); and in the same year
appeared at Antwerp both Christopher Plantin&rsquo;s and Jean Bellere&rsquo;s
pirated issues of Temporal&rsquo;s translation, and a new (very inaccurate)
Latin version by Joannes Florianus, <i>Joannis Leonis Africani de
totius Africae descriptione libri i.-ix.</i> The latter was reprinted in
1558, 1559 (Zürich), and 1632 (Leiden), and served as the basis of
John Pory&rsquo;s Elizabethan English translation, made at the suggestion
of Richard Hakluyt (<i>A Geographical Historie of Africa</i>, London,
1600). Pory&rsquo;s version was reissued, with notes, maps, &amp;c., by
Robert Brown, E. G. Ravenstein, &amp;c. (3 vols., Hakluyt Society,
London, 1896). An excellent German translation was made by
Lorsbach, from the Italian, in 1805 (<i>Johann Leos des Afrikaners
Beschreibung von Afrika</i>, Herborn). See also Francis Moore&rsquo;s
<i>Travels into the inland parts of Africa</i> (1738), containing a translation
of Leo&rsquo;s account of negro kingdoms. Heinrich Barth intended to
have made a fresh version, with a commentary, but was prevented
by death; as it is, his own great works on the Sudan are the best
elucidation of the <i>Descrizione dell&rsquo; Affrica</i>.</p>

<p>Leo also wrote lives of the Arab physicians and philosophers
(<i>De viris quibusdam illustribus apud Arabes</i>; see J. A. Fabricius,
<i>Bibliotheca Graeca</i>, Hamburg, 1726, xiii. 259-298); a Spanish-Arabic
vocabulary, now lost, but noticed by Ramusio as having
been consulted by the famous Hebrew physician, Jacob Mantino;
a collection of Arabic epitaphs in and near Fez (the MS. of this Leo
presented, it is said, to the brother of the king); and poems, also
lost. It is stated, moreover, that Leo intended writing a history
of the Mahommedan religion, an epitome of Mahommedan
chronicles, and an account of his travels in Asia and Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEO, LEONARDO<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1694-1744), more correctly <span class="sc">Lionardo
Oronzo Salvatore de Leo</span>, Italian musical composer, was born
on the 5th of August 1694 at S. Vito dei Normanni, near Brindisi.
He became a student at the Conservatorio della Piètà dei Turchini
at Naples in 1703, and was a pupil first of Provenzale and later
of Nicola Fago. It has been supposed that he was a pupil of
Pitoni and Alessandro Scarlatti, but he could not possibly have
studied with either of these composers, although he was undoubtedly
influenced by their compositions. His earliest known
work was a sacred drama, <i>L&rsquo;Infedeltà abbattuta</i>, performed by
his fellow-students in 1712. In 1714 he produced, at the court
theatre, an opera, <i>Pisistrato</i>, which was much admired. He held
various posts at the royal chapel, and continued to write for the
stage, besides teaching at the conservatorio. After adding comic
scenes to Gasparini&rsquo;s <i>Bajazette</i> in 1722 for performance at Naples,
he composed a comic opera, <i>La Mpeca scoperta</i>, in Neapolitan
dialect, in 1723. His most famous comic opera was <i>Amor vuol
sofferenze</i> (1739), better known as <i>La Finta Frascatana</i>, highly
praised by Des Brosses. He was equally distinguished as a
composer of serious opera, <i>Demofoonte</i> (1735), <i>Farnace</i> (1737)
and <i>L&rsquo;Olimpiade</i> (1737) being his most famous works in this
branch, and is still better known as a composer of sacred music.
He died of apoplexy on the 31st of October 1744 while engaged
in the composition of new airs for a revival of <i>La Finta
Frascatana</i>.</p>

<p>Leo was the first of the Neapolitan school to obtain a complete
mastery over modern harmonic counterpoint. His sacred music
is masterly and dignified, logical rather than passionate, and free
from the sentimentality which disfigures the work of F. Durante
and G. B. Pergolesi. His serious operas suffer from a coldness
and severity of style, but in his comic operas he shows a keen
sense of humour. His <i>ensemble</i> movements are spirited, but
never worked up to a strong climax.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A fine and characteristic example of his sacred music is the
<i>Dixit Dominus</i> in C, edited by C. V. Stanford and published by
Novello. A number of songs from operas are accessible in modern
editions.</p>

extensive iron-works and trade in iron are a consequence of its

set up by that king in the Philippeum at Olympia. He also
with Lysippus made a group in bronze at Delphi representing
a lion-hunt of Alexander. Of this the base with an inscription
was recently found. We hear of other statues by Leochares
of Zeus, Apollo and Ares. The statuette in the Vatican, representing
Ganymede being carried away by an eagle, though
considerably restored and poor in execution, so closely corresponds
with Pliny&rsquo;s description of a group by Leochares that
we are justified in considering it a copy of that group, especially
as the Vatican statue shows all the characteristics of Attic
4th-century art. Pliny (<i>N.H.</i> 34. 79) writes: &ldquo;Leochares
made a group of an eagle aware whom it is carrying off in Ganymede
and to whom it is bearing him; holding the boy delicately
in its claws, with his garment between.&rdquo; (For engraving see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, Plate I. fig. 53.) The tree stem is skilfully used as
a support; and the upward strain of the group is ably rendered.
The close likeness both in head and pose between the Ganymede
and the well-known Apollo Belvidere has caused some modern
archaeologists to assign the latter also to Leochares. With
somewhat more confidence we may regard the fine statue of
Alexander the Great at Munich as a copy of his gold and ivory
portrait at Olympia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOFRIC<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (d. 1057), earl of Mercia, was a son of Leofwine,
earl of Mercia, and became earl at some date previous to 1032.
Henceforth, being one of the three great earls of the realm, he
took a leading part in public affairs. On the death of King
Canute in 1035 he supported the claim of his son Harold to the
throne against that of Hardicanute; and during the quarrel
between Edward the Confessor and Earl Godwine in 1051 he
played the part of a mediator. Through his efforts civil war
was averted, and in accordance with his advice the settlement of
the dispute was referred to the Witan. When he became earl
of Mercia his direct rule seems to have been confined to Cheshire,
Staffordshire, Shropshire and the borders of north Wales, but
afterwards he extended the area of his earldom. As Chester
was his principal residence and the seat of his government, he
is sometimes called earl of Chester. Leofric died at Bromley
in Staffordshire on the 31st of August 1057. His wife was
Godgifu, famous in legend as Lady Godiva. Both husband
and wife were noted as liberal benefactors to the church, among
their foundations being the famous Benedictine monastery at
Coventry. Leofric&rsquo;s son, Ælfgar, succeeded him as earl of
Mercia.</p>

Leominster parliamentary division of Herefordshire, England,
in a rich agricultural country on the Lugg, 157 m. W.N.W. of
London and 12½ N. of Hereford on the Great Western and
London &amp; North-Western railways. Pop. (1901) 5826. Area,
8728 acres. Some fine old timber houses lend picturesqueness
to the wide streets. The parish church, of mixed architecture,
including the Norman nave of the old priory church, and containing
some of the most beautiful examples of window tracery
in England, was restored in 1866, and enlarged by the addition
of a south nave in 1879. The Butter Cross, a beautiful example
of timber work of the date 1633, was removed when the town-hall
was building, and re-erected in the pleasure ground of the
Grange. Trade is chiefly in agricultural produce, wool and cider,
as the district is rich in orchards. Brewing (from the produce
of local hop-gardens) and the manufacture of agricultural
implements are also carried on. The town is under a mayor,
four aldermen and twelve councillors.</p>

<p>Merewald, king of Mercia, is said to have founded a religious
house in Leominster (Llanlieni, Leofminstre, Lempster) in 660,
and a nunnery existed here until the Conquest, when the place
became a royal demesne. It was granted by Henry I. to the
monks of Reading, who built in it a cell of their abbey, and
under whose protection the town grew up and was exempted
from the sphere of the county and hundred courts. In 1539
it reverted to the crown; and in 1554 was incorporated, by a
charter renewed in 1562, 1563, 1605, 1666, 1685 and 1786. The
borough returned two members to the parliament of 1295 and
to other parliaments, until by the Representation Act 1867 it
lost one representative, and by the Redistribution of Seats Act
1885 separate representation. A fair was granted in the time
of Henry II., and fairs in the seasons of Michaelmas and the
feasts of St Philip and St James and of Edward the Confessor,
in 1265, 1281 and 1290 respectively. Charters to the burghers
authorized fairs on the days of St Peter and of St Simon and
St Jude in 1554, on St Bartholomew&rsquo;s day in 1605, in Mid-lent
week in 1665, and on the feast of the Purification and on the
2nd of May in 1685; these fairs have modern representatives.
A market was held by the abbey by a grant of Henry I.; Friday
is now market day. Leominster was famous for wool from the
13th to the 18th century. There were gilds of mercers, tailors,
drapers, dyers and glovers in the 16th century. In 1835 the
wool trade was said to be dead; and that of glove-making,
which had been important, was diminishing. Hops and apples
were grown in 1715.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOMINSTER,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> a township of Worcester county, Massachusetts,
U.S.A., about 45 m. N.W. of Boston and about 20 m.
N. by E. of Worcester. Pop. (1890) 7269; (1900) 12,392, of
whom 2827 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 17,580. It is
a broken, hilly district, 26.48 sq. m. in area, traversed by the
Nashua river, crossed by the Northern Division of the New
York, New Haven &amp; Hartford railroad, and by the Fitchburg
Division of the Boston &amp; Maine, and connected with Boston,
Worcester and other cities by interurban electric lines. Along
the N.E. border and mostly in the township of Lunenburg are
Whalom Lake and Whalom Park, popular pleasure resorts.
The principal villages are Leominster, 5 m. S.E. of Fitchburg,
and North Leominster; the two adjoin and are virtually one.
According to the Special U.S. Census of Manufactures of 1905
the township had in that year a greater diversity of important
manufacturing industries than any place of its size in the state,
or, probably, in the United States; its 65 manufactories, with
a capital of $4,572,726 and with a product for the year valued
at $7,501,720 (39% more than in 1900), produced celluloid
and horn work (the manufacture of which is a more important
industry here than elsewhere in the United States), celluloid
combs, furniture, paper, buttons, pianos and piano-cases,
children&rsquo;s carriages and sleds, stationery, leatherboard, worsted,
woollen and cotton goods, shirts, paper boxes, &amp;c. Leominster
owns and operates its water-works. The township was formed
from a part of Lancaster township in 1740.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEÓN, LUIS PONCE DE<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> (1527-1591), Spanish poet and
mystic, was born at Belmonte de Cuenca, entered the university
of Salamanca at the age of fourteen, and in 1544 joined the
Augustinian order. In 1561 he obtained a theological chair at
Salamanca, to which in 1571 was added that of sacred literature.
He was denounced to the Inquisition for translating the book
of Canticles, and for criticizing the text of the Vulgate. He
was consequently imprisoned at Valladolid from March 1572
till December 1576; the charges against him were then
abandoned, and he was released with an admonition. He
returned to Salamanca as professor of Biblical exegesis, and
was again reported to the Inquisition in 1582, but without result.
In 1583-1585 he published the three books of a celebrated
mystic treatise, <i>Los Nombres de Cristo</i>, which he had written in
prison. In 1583 also appeared the most popular of his prose
works, a treatise entitled <i>La Perfecta Casada</i>, for the use of a
lady newly married. Ten days before his death, which occurred
at Madrigal on the 23rd of August 1591, he was elected vicar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
general of the Augustinian order. Luis de León is not only the
greatest of Spanish mystics; he is among the greatest of Spanish
lyrical poets. His translations of Euripides, Pindar, Virgil and
Horace are singularly happy; his original pieces, whether devout
like the ode <i>De la vida del cielo</i>, or secular like the ode <i>A Salinas</i>,
are instinct with a serene sublimity unsurpassed in any literature,
and their form is impeccable. Absorbed by less worldly interests,
Fray Luis de León refrained from printing his poems, which
were not issued till 1631, when Quevedo published them as a
counterblast to <i>culteranismo</i>.</p>

<p>The best edition of Luis de León&rsquo;s works is that of Merino (6 vols.,

Miss Elizabeth Wallace (Chicago, 1903). See <i>Coleccion de documentos

was born in Leon (Spain) in the middle of the 13th century and
died at Arevalo. His fame is due to his authorship of the most
influential Kabbalist work, the <i>Zohar</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kabbala</a></span>), which was
attributed to Simon b. Yo&#7717;ai, a Rabbi of the 2nd century. In
modern times the discovery of the modernity of the <i>Zohar</i> has
led to injustice to the author. Moses de Leon undoubtedly
used old materials and out of them constructed a work of genius.
The discredit into which he fell was due partly to the unedifying
incidents of his personal career. He led a wandering life, and
was more or less of an adventurer. But as to the greatness
of his work, the profundity of his philosophy and the brilliance
of his religious idealism, there can be no question.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEON OF MODENA<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1571-1648), Jewish scholar, was born in
Venice, of a notable French family which had migrated to
Italy after the expulsion of the Jews from France. He was
a precocious child, but, as Graetz points out, his lack of stable
character prevented his gifts from maturing. &ldquo;He pursued
all sorts of occupations to support himself, viz. those of preacher,
teacher of Jews and Christians, reader of prayers, interpreter,
writer, proof-reader, bookseller, broker, merchant, rabbi,
musician, matchmaker and manufacturer of amulets.&rdquo; Though
he failed to rise to real distinction he earned a place by his
criticism of the Talmud among those who prepared the way for
the new learning in Judaism. One of Leon&rsquo;s most effective
works was his attack on the Kabbala (<i>&rsquo;Ari Nohem</i>, first published
in 1840), for in it he demonstrated that the &ldquo;Bible of the
Kabbalists&rdquo; (the <i>Zohar</i>) was a modern composition. He became
best known, however, as the interpreter of Judaism to the
Christian world. At the instance of an English nobleman he
prepared an account of the religious customs of the Synagogue,
<i>Riti Ebraici</i> (1637). This book was widely read by Christians;
it was rendered into various languages, and in 1650 was translated
into English by Edward Chilmead. At the time the Jewish
question was coming to the fore in London, and Leon of Modena&rsquo;s
book did much to stimulate popular interest. He died at
Venice.</p>

Mexico, 209 m. N.W. of the federal capital and 30 m. W.
by N. of the city of Guanajuato. Pop. (1895) 90,978; (1900)
62,623, León ranking fourth in the latter year among the cities
of Mexico. The Mexican Central gives it railway connexion with
the national capital and other prominent cities of the Republic.
León stands in a fertile plain on the banks of the Turbio, a
tributary of the Rio Grande de Lerma, at an elevation of 5862 ft.
above sea-level and in the midst of very attractive surroundings.
The country about León is considered to be one of the richest
cereal-producing districts of Mexico. The city itself is subject
to disastrous floods, sometimes leading to loss of life as well as
damage to property, as in the great flood of 1889. León is
essentially a manufacturing and commercial city; it has a
cathedral and a theatre, the latter one of the largest and finest
in the republic. The city is regularly built, with wide streets
and numerous shady parks and gardens. It manufactures
saddlery and other leather work, gold and silver embroideries,
cotton and woollen goods, especially <i>rebozos</i> (long shawls), soap
and cutlery. There are also tanneries and flour mills. The
city has a considerable trade in wheat and flour. The first
settlement of León occurred in 1552, but its formal foundation
was in 1576, and it did not reach the dignity of a city until 1836.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEON,<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> the capital of the department of Leon, Nicaragua, an
episcopal see, and the largest city in the republic, situated midway
between Lake Managua and the Pacific Ocean, 50 m. N.W. of
Managua, on the railway from that city to the Pacific port of
Corinto. Pop. (1905) about 45,000, including the Indian town
of Subtiaba. Leon covers a very wide area, owing to its gardens
and plantations. Its houses are usually one-storeyed, built of
adobe and roofed with red tiles; its public buildings are among
the finest in Central America. The massive and elaborately
ornamented cathedral was built in the Renaissance style between
1746 and 1774; a Dominican church in Subtiaba is little less
striking. The old (1678) and new (1873) episcopal palaces, the
hospital, the university and the barracks (formerly a Franciscan
monastery) are noteworthy examples of Spanish colonial architecture.
Leon has a large general trade, and manufactures
cotton and woollen fabrics, ice, cigars, boots, shoes and saddlery;
its tanneries supply large quantities of cheap leather for export.
But its population (about 60,000 in 1850) tends to decrease.</p>

<p>At the time of the Spanish conquest Subtiaba was the residence
of the great cacique of Nagrando, and contained an important
Indian temple. The city of Leon, founded by Francisco Hernandez
de Cordova in 1523, was originally situated at the head
of the western bay of Lake Managua, and was not removed to
its present position till 1610. Thomas Gage, who visited it in
1665, describes it as a splendid city; and in 1685 it yielded rich
booty to William Dampier (<i>q.v.</i>). Until 1855 Leon was the
capital of Nicaragua, although its great commercial rival Granada
contested its claim to that position, and the jealousy between
the two cities often resulted in bloodshed. Leon was identified
with the interests of the democracy of Nicaragua, Granada with
the clerical and aristocratic parties.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEON,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> the name of a modern province and of an ancient
kingdom, captaincy-general and province in north-western Spain.
The modern province, founded in 1833, is bounded on the N. by
Oviedo, N.E. by Santander, E. by Palencia, S. by Valladolid
and Zamora and W. by Orense and Lugo. Pop. (1900) 386,083.
Area, 5986 sq. m. The boundaries of the province on the north
and west, formed respectively by the central ridge and southerly
offshoots of the Cantabrian Mountains (<i>q.v.</i>), are strongly
marked; towards the south-east the surface merges imperceptibly
into the Castilian plateau, the line of demarcation being
for the most part merely conventional. Leon belongs partly
to the river system of the Miño (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span>), partly to that of the
Duero or Douro (<i>q.v.</i>), these being separated by the Montañas de
Leon, which extend in a continuous wall (with passes at Manzanal
and Poncebadon) from north to south-west. To the north-west
of the Montañas de Leon is the richly wooded pastoral and
highland district known as the Vierzo, which in its lower valleys
produces grain, fruit, and wine in abundance. The Tierra del
Campo in the west of the province is fairly productive, but in
need of irrigation. The whole province is sparsely peopled.
Apart from agriculture, stock-raising and mining, its commerce
and industries are unimportant. Cattle, mules, butter, leather,
coal and iron are exported. The hills of Leon were worked for
gold in the time of the Romans; iron is still obtained, and coal-mining
developed considerably towards the close of the 19th
century. The only towns with more than 5000 inhabitants in
1900 were Leon (15,580) and Astorga (5573) (<i>q.v.</i>). The main
railway from Madrid to Corunna passes through the province,
and there are branches from the city of Leon to Vierzo, Oviedo,
and the Biscayan port of Gijón.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>444</span></p>

<p>At the time of the Roman conquest, the province was inhabited
by the Vettones and Callaici; it afterwards formed part of
Hispania Tarraconensis. Among the Christian kingdoms which
arose in Spain as the Moorish invasion of the 8th century receded,
Leon was one of the oldest. The title of king of Leon was first
assumed by Ordoño in 913. Ferdinand I. (the Great) of Castile
united the crowns of Castile and Leon in the 11th century; the
two were again separated in the 12th, until a final union took
place (1230) in the person of St Ferdinand. The limits of the
kingdom varied with the vicissitudes of war, but roughly speaking
it may be said to have embraced what are now the provinces of
Leon, Palencia, Valladolid, Zamora and Salamanca. For a
detailed account of this kingdom, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span>: <i>History</i>. The
captaincy-general of the province of Leon before 1833 included
Leon, Zamora and Salamanca. The Leonese, or inhabitants of
these three provinces, have less individuality, in character and
physique, than the people of Galicia, Catalonia or Andalusia,
who are quite distinct from what is usually regarded as the central
or national Spanish type, <i>i.e.</i> the Castilian. The Leonese belong
partly to the Castilian section of the Spaniards, partly to the
north-western section which includes the Galicians and Asturians.
They have comparatively few of the Moorish traits which are so
marked in the south and east of Spain. Near Astorga there
dwells a curious tribe, the Maragatos, sometimes considered to be
a remnant of the original Celtiberian inhabitants. As a rule the
Maragatos earn their living as muleteers or carriers; they wear a
distinctive costume, mix as little as possible with their neighbours
and do not marry outside their own tribe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEON,<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> an episcopal see and the capital of the Spanish province
of Leon, situated on a hill 2631 ft. above sea-level, in the angle
made by the Torio and Bernesga, streams which unite on the
south, and form the river Leon, a tributary of the Esla. Pop.
(1900) 15,580. Leon is on the main railway from Madrid to
Oviedo, and is connected with Astorga by a branch line. The
older quarters of the city, which contain the cathedral and other
medieval buildings, are surrounded by walls, and have lost little
of their beauty and interest from the restoration carried out in the
second half of the 19th century. During the same period new
suburbs grew up outside the walls to house the industrial population
which was attracted by the development of iron-founding
and the manufacture of machinery, railway-plant, chemicals and
leather. Leon thus comprises two towns&mdash;the old, which is
mainly ecclesiastical in its character, and the new, which is
industrial. The cathedral, founded in 1199 and only finished at
the close of the 14th century, is built of a warm cream-coloured
stone, and is remarkable for simplicity, lightness and strength.
It is one of the finest examples of Spanish Gothic, smaller, indeed,
than the cathedrals of Burgos and Toledo, but exquisite in design
and workmanship. The chapter library contains some valuable
manuscripts. The collegiate church of San Isidoro was founded
by Ferdinand I. of Castile in 1063 and consecrated in 1149.
Its architecture is Romanesque. The church contains some fine
plate, including the silver reliquary in which the bones of St
Isidore of Seville are preserved, and a silver processional cross
dating from the 16th century, which is one of the most beautiful
in the country. The convent and church of San Marcos, planned
in 1514 by Ferdinand the Catholic, founded by Charles V. in 1537,
and consecrated in 1541, are Renaissance in style. They are
built on the site of a hostel used by pilgrims on their way to
Santiago de Compostela. The provincial museum occupies the
chapterhouse and contains some interesting Roman monuments.
The lower part of the city walls consists of Roman masonry
dating from the 3rd century. Other buildings are the high
school, ecclesiastical seminaries, hospital, episcopal palace and
municipal and provincial halls.</p>

<p>Leon (Arab. <i>Liyun</i>) owes its name to the Legio Septima
Gemina of Galba, which, under the later emperors, had its headquarters
here. About 540 Leon fell into the hands of the Gothic
king Leovigild, and in 717 it capitulated to the Moors. Retaken
about 742, it ultimately, in the beginning of the 10th century,
became the capital of the kingdom of Leon (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span>: <i>History</i>).
About 996 it was taken by Almansur, but on his death soon
afterwards it reverted to the Spaniards. It was the seat of
several ecclesiastical councils, the first of which was held under
Alphonso V. in 1012 and the last in 1288.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEONARDO DA VINCI<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> (1452-1519), the great Italian painter,
sculptor, architect, musician, mechanician, engineer and natural
philosopher, was the son of a Florentine lawyer, born out of
wedlock by a mother in a humble station, variously described
as a peasant and as of gentle birth. The place of his birth
was Vinci, a <i>castello</i> or fortified hill village in the Florentine
territory near Empoli, from which his father&rsquo;s family derived
its name. The Christian name of the father was Piero (the
son of Antonio the son of Piero the son of Guido, all of whom
had been men of law like their descendant). Leonardo&rsquo;s mother
was called Catarina. Her relations with Ser Piero da Vinci
seem to have come to an end almost immediately upon the birth
of their son. She was soon afterwards married to one Accattabriga
di Piero del Vacca, of Vinci. Ser Piero on his part was
four times married, and had by his last two wives nine sons and
two daughters; but he had from the first acknowledged the
boy Leonardo and brought him up in his own house, principally,
no doubt, at Florence. In that city Ser Piero followed his
profession with success, as notary to many of the chief families in
the city, including the Medici, and afterwards to the signory or
governing council of the state. The son born to him before
marriage grew up into a youth of shining promise. To splendid
beauty and activity of person he joined a winning charm of
temper and manners, a tact for all societies, and an aptitude for
all accomplishments. An inexhaustible intellectual energy and
curiosity lay beneath this amiable surface. Among the multifarious
pursuits to which the young Leonardo set his hand,
the favourites at first were music, drawing and modelling. His
father showed some of his drawings to an acquaintance, Andrea
del Verrocchio, who at once recognized the boy&rsquo;s artistic vocation,
and was selected by Ser Piero to be his master.</p>

<p>Verrocchio, although hardly one of the great creative or inventive
forces in the art of his age at Florence, was a first-rate
craftsman alike as goldsmith, sculptor and painter, and particularly
distinguished as a teacher. In his studio Leonardo worked
for several years (about 1470-1477) in the company of Lorenzo
di Credi and other less celebrated pupils. Among his contemporaries
he formed special ties of friendship with the painters
Sandro Botticelli and Pietro Perugino. He had soon learnt all
that Verrocchio had to teach&mdash;more than all, if we are to believe
the oft-told tale of the figure, or figures, executed by the pupil
in the picture of Christ&rsquo;s Baptism designed by the master for
the monks of Vallombrosa. The work in question is now in the
Academy at Florence. According to Vasari the angel kneeling
on the left, with a drapery over the right arm, was put in by
Leonardo, and when Verrocchio saw it his sense of its superiority
to his own work caused him to forswear painting for ever after.
The latter part of the story is certainly false. The picture,
originally painted in tempera, has suffered much from later
repaints in oil, rendering exact judgment difficult. The most
competent opinion inclines to acknowledge the hand of Leonardo,
not only in the face of the angel, but also in parts of the drapery
and of the landscape background. The work was probably
done in or about 1470, when Leonardo was eighteen years old.
By 1472 we find him enrolled in the lists of the painters&rsquo; gild
at Florence. Here he continued to live and work for ten or eleven
years longer. Up till 1477 he is still spoken of as a pupil or
apprentice of Verrocchio; but in that year he seems to have been
taken into special favour by Lorenzo the Magnificent, and to
have worked as an independent artist under his patronage until
1482-1483. In 1478 we find him receiving an important commission
from the signory, and in 1480 another from the monks
of San Donato in Scopeto.</p>

<p>Leonardo was not one of those artists of the Renaissance
who sought the means of reviving the ancient glories of art
mainly in the imitation of ancient models. The antiques of
the Medici gardens seem to have had little influence on him
beyond that of generally stimulating his passion for perfection.
By his own instincts he was an exclusive student of nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>445</span>
From his earliest days he had flung himself upon that study
with an unprecedented ardour of delight and curiosity. In
drawing from life he had early found the way to unite precision
with freedom and fire&mdash;the subtlest accuracy of expressive
definition with vital movement and rhythm of line&mdash;as no
draughtsman had been able to unite them before. He was the
first painter to recognize the play of light and shade as among
the most significant and attractive of the world&rsquo;s appearances,
the earlier schools having with one consent subordinated light
and shade to colour and outline. Nor was he a student of the
broad, usual, patent appearances only of the world; its fugitive,
fantastic, unaccustomed appearances attracted him most of all.
Strange shapes of hills and rocks, rare plants and animals,
unusual faces and figures of men, questionable smiles and expressions,
whether beautiful or grotesque, far-fetched objects
and curiosities, were things he loved to pore upon and keep in
memory. Neither did he stop at mere appearances of any kind,
but, having stamped the image of things upon his brain, went
on indefatigably to probe their hidden laws and causes. He
soon satisfied himself that the artist who was content to reproduce
the external aspects of things without searching into the
hidden workings of nature behind them, was one but half
equipped for his calling. Every fresh artistic problem immediately
became for him a far-reaching scientific problem as well.
The laws of light and shade, the laws of &ldquo;perspective,&rdquo; including
optics and the physiology of the eye, the laws of human and
animal anatomy and muscular movement, those of the growth
and structure of plants and of the powers and properties of water,
all these and much more furnished food almost from the beginning
to his insatiable spirit of inquiry.</p>

<p>The evidence of the young man&rsquo;s predilections and curiosities
is contained in the legends which tell of lost works produced
by him in youth. One of these was a cartoon or monochrome
painting of Adam and Eve in tempera, and in this, besides the
beauty of the figures, the infinite truth and elaboration of the
foliage and animals in the background are celebrated in terms
which bring to mind the treatment of the subject by Albrecht
Dürer in his famous engraving done thirty years later. Again,
a peasant of Vinci having in his simplicity asked Ser Piero to get
a picture painted for him on a wooden shield, the father is said
to have laughingly handed on the commission to his son, who
thereupon shut himself up with all the noxious insects and
grotesque reptiles he could find, observed and drew and dissected
them assiduously, and produced at last a picture of a dragon
compounded of their various shapes and aspects, which was so
fierce and so life-like as to terrify all who saw it. With equal
research and no less effect he painted on another occasion the
head of a snaky-haired Medusa. (A picture of this subject which
long did duty at the Uffizi for Leonardo&rsquo;s work is in all likelihood
merely the production of some later artist to whom the descriptions
of that work have given the cue.) Lastly, Leonardo is
related to have begun work in sculpture about this time by
modelling several heads of smiling women and children.</p>

<p>Of certified and accepted paintings produced by the young
genius, whether during his apprentice or his independent years
at Florence (about 1470-1482), very few are extant, and the
two most important are incomplete. A small and charming
strip of an oblong &ldquo;Annunciation&rdquo; at the Louvre is generally
accepted as his work, done soon after 1470; a very highly
wrought drawing at the Uffizi, corresponding on a larger scale
to the head of the Virgin in the same picture, seems rather to be
a copy by a later hand. This little Louvre &ldquo;Annunciation&rdquo;
is not very compatible in style with another and larger, much-debated
&ldquo;Annunciation&rdquo; at the Uffizi, which manifestly came
from the workshop of Verrocchio about 1473-1474, and which
many critics claim confidently for the young Leonardo. It may
have been joint studio-work of Verrocchio and his pupils including
Leonardo, who certainly was concerned in it, since a study for the
sleeve of the angel, preserved at Christ Church, Oxford, is unquestionably
by his hand. The landscape, with its mysterious
spiry mountains and winding waters, is very Leonardesque
both in this picture and in another contemporary product of the
workshop, or as some think of Leonardo&rsquo;s hand, namely a very
highly and coldly finished small &ldquo;Madonna with a Pink&rdquo; at
Munich. The likeness he is recorded to have painted of Ginevra
de&rsquo; Benci used to be traditionally identified with the fine portrait
of a matron at the Pitti absurdly known as <i>La Monaca</i>: more
lately it has been recognized in a rather dull, expressionless
Verrocchiesque portrait of a young woman with a fanciful
background of pine-sprays in the Liechtenstein gallery at
Vienna. Neither attribution can be counted convincing.
Several works of sculpture, including a bas-relief at Pistoia and a
small terra-cotta model of a St John at the Victoria and Albert
Museum, have also been claimed, but without general consent, as
the young master&rsquo;s handiwork. Of many brilliant early drawings
by him, the first that can be dated is a study of landscape done
in 1473. A magnificent silver-point head of a Roman warrior
at the British Museum was clearly done, from or for a bas-relief,
under the immediate influence of Verrocchio. A number of
studies of heads in pen or silver point, with some sketches
for Madonnas, including a charming series in the British Museum
for a &ldquo;Madonna with the Cat,&rdquo; may belong to the same years
or the first years of his independence. A sheet with two studies
of heads bears a MS. note of 1478, saying that in one of the last
months of that year he began painting the &ldquo;Two Maries.&rdquo; One
of the two may have been a picture of the Virgin appearing to
St Bernard, which we know he was commissioned to paint in that
year for a chapel in the Palace of the Signory, but never finished:
the commission was afterwards transferred to Filippino Lippi,
whose performance is now in the Badia. One of the two heads on
this dated sheet may probably have been a study for the same
St Bernard; it was used afterwards by some follower for a St
Leonard in a stiff and vapid &ldquo;Ascension of Christ,&rdquo; wrongly
attributed to the master himself in the Berlin Museum. A
pen-drawing representing a ringleader of the Pazzi conspiracy,
Bernardo Baroncelli, hung out of a window of the Bargello after
his surrender by the sultan at Constantinople to the emissaries
of Florence, can be dated from its subject as done in December
1479. A number of his best drawings of the next following
years are preparatory pen-studies for an altar-piece of the
&ldquo;Adoration of the Magi,&rdquo; undertaken early in 1481 on the commission
of the monks of S. Donato at Scopeto. The preparation
in monochrome for this picture, a work of extraordinary power
both of design and physiognomical expression, is preserved
at the Uffizi, but the painting itself was never carried out, and
after Leonardo&rsquo;s failure to fulfil his contract Filippino Lippi
had once more to be employed in his place. Of equal or even
more intense power, though of narrower scope, is an unfinished
monochrome preparation for a St Jerome, found accidentally
at Rome by Cardinal Fesch and now in the Vatican gallery;
this also seems to belong to the first Florentine period, but is
not mentioned in documents.</p>

<p>The tale of completed work for these twelve or fourteen years
(1470-1483 or thereabouts) is thus very scanty. But it must
be remembered that Leonardo was already full of projects in
mechanics, hydraulics, architecture, and military and civil
engineering, ardently feeling his way in the work of experimental
study and observation in every branch of theoretical or applied
science in which any beginning had been made in his age, as
well as in some in which he was himself the first pioneer. He was
full of new ideas concerning both the laws and the applications of
mechanical forces. His architectural and engineering projects
were of a daring which amazed even the fellow-citizens of Alberti
and Brunelleschi. History presents few figures more attractive
to the mind&rsquo;s eye than that of Leonardo during this period of
his all-capable and dazzling youth. He did not indeed escape
calumny, and was even denounced on a charge of immoral
practices, but fully and honourably acquitted. There was
nothing about him, as there was afterwards about Michelangelo,
dark-tempered, secret or morose; he was open and genial with
all men. He has indeed praised &ldquo;the self-sufficing power of
solitude&rdquo; in almost the same phrase as Wordsworth, and from
time to time would even in youth seclude himself for a season
in complete intellectual absorption, as when he toiled among his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>446</span>
bats and wasps and lizards, forgetful of rest and food, and insensible
to the noisomeness of their corruption. But we have to
picture him as anon coming out and gathering about him a
tatterdemalion company, and jesting with them until they were
in fits of laughter, for the sake of observing their burlesque
physiognomies; anon as eagerly frequenting the society of men
of science and learning of an older generation like the mathematician
Benedetto Aritmetico, the physician, geographer
and astronomer Paolo Toscanelli, the famous Greek Aristotelian
Giovanni Argiropoulo; or as out-rivalling all the youth of the
city now by charm of recitation, now by skill in music and now
by feats of strength and horsemanship; or as stopping to buy
caged birds in the market that he might set them free and watch
them rejoicing in their flight; or again as standing radiant
in his rose-coloured cloak and his rich gold hair among the
throng of young and old on the piazza, and holding them spellbound
while he expatiated on the great projects in art and
mechanics that were teeming in his mind. Unluckily it is to
written records and to imagination that we have to trust exclusively
for our picture. No portrait of Leonardo as he
appeared during this period of his life has come down to us.</p>

<p>But his far-reaching schemes and studies brought him no
immediate gain, and diverted him from the tasks by which he
should have supported himself. For all his shining power and
promise he remained poor. Probably also his exclusive belief
in experimental methods, and slight regard for mere authority
whether in science or art made the intellectual atmosphere
of the Medicean circle, with its passionate mixed cult of the
classic past and of a Christianity mystically blended and reconciled
with Platonism, uncongenial to him. At any rate he was
ready to leave Florence when the chance was offered him of
fixed service at the court of Ludovico Sforza (il Moro) at Milan.
Soon after that prince had firmly established his power as nominal
guardian and protector of his nephew Gian Galeazzo but really
as usurping ruler of the state, he revived a project previously
mooted for the erection of an equestrian monument in honour
of the founder of his house&rsquo;s greatness, Francesco Sforza, and
consulted Lorenzo dei Medici on the choice of an artist. Lorenzo
recommended the young Leonardo, who went to Milan accordingly
(at some uncertain date in or about 1483), taking as a gift
from Lorenzo and a token of his own skill a silver lute of wondrous
sweetness fashioned in the likeness of a horse&rsquo;s head. Hostilities
were at the moment imminent between Milan and Venice; it
was doubtless on that account that in the letter commending himself
to the duke, and setting forth his own capacities, Leonardo
rests his title to patronage chiefly on his attainments and inventions
in military engineering. After asserting these in detail
under nine different heads, he speaks under a tenth of his proficiency
as a civil engineer and architect, and adds lastly a brief
paragraph with reference to what he can do in painting and
sculpture, undertaking in particular to carry out in a fitting
manner the monument to Francesco Sforza.</p>

<p>The first definite documentary evidence of Leonardo&rsquo;s employments
at Milan dates from 1487. Some biographers have
supposed that the interval, or part of it, between 1483 and that
date was occupied by travels in the East. The grounds of the
supposition are some drafts occurring among his MSS. of a
letter addressed to the <i>diodario</i> or <i>diwâdar</i> of Syria, lieutenant
of the sultan of Babylon (Babylon meaning according to a usage
of that time Cairo). In these drafts Leonardo describes in the
first person, with sketches, a traveller&rsquo;s strange experiences
in Egypt, Cyprus, Constantinople, the Cilician coasts about
Mount Taurus and Armenia. He relates the rise and persecution
of a prophet and preacher, the catastrophe of a falling mountain
and submergence of a great city, followed by a general inundation,
and the claim of the prophet to have foretold these disasters;
adding physical descriptions of the Euphrates river
and the marvellous effects of sunset light on the Taurus range.
No contemporary gives the least hint of Leonardo&rsquo;s having
travelled in the East; to the places he mentions he gives their
classical and not their current Oriental names; the catastrophes
he describes are unattested from any other source; he confuses
the Taurus and the Caucasus; some of the phenomena he
mentions are repeated from Aristotle and Ptolemy; and there
seems little reason to doubt that these passages in his MSS.
are merely his drafts of a projected geographical treatise or
perhaps romance. He had a passion for geography and travellers&rsquo;
tales, for descriptions of natural wonders and ruined cities, and
was himself a practised fictitious narrator and fabulist, as other
passages in his MSS. prove. Neither is the gap in the account
of his doings after he first went to the court of Milan really so
complete as has been represented. Ludovico was vehemently
denounced and attacked during the earlier years of his usurpation,
especially by the partisans of his sister-in-law Bona of
Savoy, the mother of the rightful duke, young Gian Galeazzo.
To repel these attacks he employed the talents of a number of
court poets and artists, who in public recitation and pageant,
in emblematic picture and banner and device, proclaimed the
wisdom and kindness of his guardianship and the wickedness
of his assailants. That Leonardo was among the artists thus
employed is proved both by notes and projects among his MSS.
and by allegoric sketches still extant. Several such sketches
are at Christ Church, Oxford: one shows a horned hag or she-fiend
urging her hounds to an attack on the state of Milan, and
baffled by the Prudence and Justice of Il Moro (all this made
clear by easily recognizable emblems). The allusion must almost
certainly be to the attempted assassination of Ludovico by agents
of the duchess Bona in 1484. Again, it must have been the
pestilence decimating Milan in 1484-1485 which gave occasion
to the projects submitted by Leonardo to Ludovico for breaking
up the city and reconstructing it on improved sanitary principles.
To 1485-1486 also appears to belong the inception of his
elaborate though unfulfilled architectural plans for beautifying
and strengthening the <i>Castello</i>, the great stronghold of the ruling
power in the state. Very soon afterwards he must have begun
work upon his plans and models, undertaken during an acute
phase of the competition which the task had called forth between
German and Italian architects, for another momentous
enterprise, the completion of Milan cathedral. Extant records
of payments made to him in connexion with these architectural
plans extend from August 1487 to May 1490: in the upshot
none of them was carried out. From the beginning of his
residence with Ludovico his combination of unprecedented
mechanical ingenuity with apt allegoric invention and courtly
charm and eloquence had made him the directing spirit
in all court ceremonies and festivities. On the occasion of the
marriage of the young duke Gian Galeazzo with Isabella of
Aragon in 1487, we find Leonardo devising all the mechanical
and spectacular part of a masque of Paradise; and presently
afterwards designing a bathing pavilion of unheard-of beauty
and ingenuity for the young duchess. Meanwhile he was filling
his note-books as busily as ever with the results of his studies
in statics and dynamics, in human anatomy, geometry and
the phenomena of light and shade. It is probable that from
the first he had not forgotten his great task of the Sforza monument,
with its attendant researches in equine movement and
anatomy, and in the science and art of bronze casting on a great
scale. The many existing sketches for the work (of which the
chief collection is at Windsor) cannot be distinctly dated. In
1490, the seventh year of his residence at Milan, after some
expressions of impatience on the part of his patron, he had all
but got his model ready for display on the occasion of the
marriage of Ludovico with Beatrice d&rsquo;Este, but at the last
moment was dissatisfied with what he had done and determined
to begin all over again.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1490, Leonardo enjoyed some months of
uninterrupted mathematical and physical research in the libraries
and among the learned men of Pavia, whither he had been called
to advise on some architectural difficulties concerning the
cathedral. Here also the study of an ancient equestrian monument
(the so-called <i>Regisole</i>, destroyed in 1796) gave him fresh
ideas for his Francesco Sforza. In January 1491 a double
Sforza-Este marriage (Ludovico Sforza himself with Beatrice
d&rsquo;Este, Alfonso d&rsquo;Este with Anna Sforza the sister of Gian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>447</span>
Galeazzo) again called forth his powers as a masque and pageant-master.
For the next following years the ever-increasing
gaiety and splendour of the Milanese court gave him continual
employment in similar kinds, including the composition and
recitation of jests, tales, fables and &ldquo;prophecies&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> moral and
social satires and allegories cast in the future tense); among
his MSS. occur the drafts of many such, some of them both
profound and pungent. Meanwhile he was again at work upon
the monument to Francesco Sforza, and this time to practical
purpose. When ambassadors from Austria came to Milan
towards the close of 1493 to escort the betrothed bride of their
emperor Maximilian, Bianca Maria Sforza, away on her nuptial
journey, the finished colossal model, 26 ft. high, was at last
in its place for all to see in the courtyard of the Castello. Contemporary
accounts attest the magnificence of the work and
the enthusiasm it excited, but are not precise enough to enable
us to judge to which of the two main groups of extant sketches
its design corresponded. One of these groups shows the horse
and rider in relatively tranquil march, in the manner of the
Gattemalata monument put up fifty years before by Donatello
at Padua and the Colleoni monument on which Verocchio was
now engaged at Venice. Another group of sketches shows the
horse galloping or rearing in violent action, in some instances
in the act of trampling a fallen enemy. Neither is it possible
to discriminate with certainty the sketches intended for the
Sforza monument from others which Leonardo may have done
in view of another and later commission for an equestrian statue,
namely, that in honour of Ludovico&rsquo;s great enemy, Gian Giacomo
Trivulzio.</p>

<p>The year 1494 is a momentous one in the history of Italian
politics. In that year the long ousted and secluded prince,
Gian Galeazzo, died under circumstances more than suspicious.
In that year Ludovico, now duke of Milan in his own right, for
the strengthening of his power against Naples, first entered into
those intrigues with Charles VIII. of France which later brought
upon Italy successive floods of invasion, revolution and calamity.
The same year was one of special importance in the prodigiously
versatile activities of Leonardo da Vinci. Documents show him,
among other things, planning during an absence of several
months from the city vast new engineering works for improving
the irrigation and water-ways of the Lomellina and adjacent
regions of the Lombard plain; ardently studying phenomena
of storm and lightning, of river action and of mountain structure;
co-operating with his friend, Donato Bramante, the great
architect, in fresh designs for the improvement and embellishment
of the Castello at Milan; and petitioning the duke to
secure him proper payment for a Madonna lately executed with
the help of his pupil, Ambrogio de Predis, for the brotherhood of
the Conception of St Francis at Milan. (This is almost certainly
the fine, slightly altered second version of the &ldquo;Virgin of the
Rocks,&rdquo; now in the National Gallery, London. The original
and earlier version is one of the glories of the Louvre, and shows
far more of a Florentine and less of a Milanese character than
the London picture.) In the same year, 1494, or early in the
next, Leonardo, if Vasari is to be trusted, paid a visit to Florence
to take part in deliberations concerning the projected new
council-hall to be constructed in the palace of the Signory.
Lastly, recent research has proved that it was in 1494 that
Leonardo got to work in earnest on what was to prove not only
by far his greatest but by far his most expeditiously and steadily
executed work in painting. This was the &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo;
undertaken for the refectory of the convent church of Sta
Maria delle Grazie at Milan on the joint commission (as it would
appear) of Ludovico and of the monks themselves.</p>

<p>This picture, the world-famous &ldquo;Cenacolo&rdquo; of Leonardo, has
been the subject of much erroneous legend and much misdirected
experiment. Having through centuries undergone cruel injury,
from technical imperfections at the outset, from disastrous
atmospheric conditions, from vandalism and neglect, and most
of all from unskilled repair, its remains have at last (1904-1908)
been treated with a mastery of scientific resource and a tenderness
of conscientious skill that have revived for ourselves and for
posterity a great part of its power. At the same time its true
history has been investigated and re-established. The intensity
of intellectual and manual application which Leonardo threw
into the work is proved by the fact that he finished it within
four years, in spite of all his other avocations and of those
prolonged pauses of concentrated imaginative effort and intense
self-critical brooding to which we have direct contemporary
witness. He painted the picture on the wall in tempera, not,
according to the legend which sprung up within twenty years
of its completion, in oil. The tempera vehicle, perhaps including
new experimental ingredients, did not long hold firmly to its
plaster ground, nor that to the wall. Flaking and scaling set in;
hard crusts of mildew formed, dissolved and re-formed with
changes of weather over both the loosened parts and those that
remained firm. Decade after decade these processes went
on, a rain of minute scales and grains falling, according to one
witness, continually from the surface, till the picture seemed to
be perishing altogether. In the 18th century attempts were first
made at restoration. They all proceeded on the false assumption,
dating from the early years of the 16th century, that the
work had been executed in oil. With oil it was accordingly
at one time saturated in hopes of reviving the colours. Other
experimenters tried various &ldquo;secrets,&rdquo; which for the most part
meant deleterious glues and varnishes. Fortunately not very
much of actual repainting was accomplished except on some
parts of the garments. The chief operations were carried on by
Bellotti in 1726, by Mazza in 1770, and by Barezzi in 1819 and
the following years. None of them arrested, some actually
accelerated, the natural agencies of damp and disintegration,
decay and mildew. Yet this mere ghost of a picture, this
evocation, half vanished as it was, by a great world-genius of
a mighty spiritual world-event, remained a thing indescribably
impressive. The ghost has now been brought back to much
of true life again by the skill of the most scrupulous of all
restorers, Cavaliere Cavenaghi, who, acting under the authority
of a competent commission, and after long and patient experiment,
found it possible to secure to the wall the innumerable blistered,
mildewed and half-detached flakes and scales of the original
work that yet remained, to clear the surface thus obtained of
much of the obliterating accretions due to decay and mishandling,
and to bring the whole to unity by touching tenderly in with
tempera the spots and spaces actually left bare. A further
gain obtained through these operations has been the uncovering,
immediately above the main subject, of a beautiful scheme of
painted lunettes and vaultings, the lunettes filled by Leonardo&rsquo;s
hand with inscribed scutcheons and interlaced plait or knot
ornaments (<i>intrecciamenti</i>), the vaultings with stars on a blue
ground. The total result, if adequate steps can be taken to
counteract the effects of atmospheric change in future, will
remain a splendid gain for posterity and a happy refutation of
D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s despairing poem, the <i>Death of a Masterpiece</i>.</p>

<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Supper,&rdquo; for all its injuries, became from
the first, and has ever since remained, for all Christendom
the typical representation of the scene. Goethe in his famous
criticism has said all that needs to be said of it. The
painter has departed from precedent in grouping the disciples,
with their Master in the midst, along the far side and the two
ends of a long, narrow table, and in leaving the near or service
side of the table towards the spectator free. The chamber is
seen in a perfectly symmetrical perspective, its rear wall pierced
by three plain openings which admit the sense of quiet distance
and mystery from the open landscape beyond; by the central
of these openings, which is the widest of the three, the head and
shoulders of the Saviour are framed in. On His right and left
are ranged the disciples in equal numbers. The furniture and
accessories of the chamber, very simply conceived, have been
rendered with scrupulous exactness and distinctness; yet
they leave to the human and dramatic elements the absolute
mastery of the scene. The serenity of the holy company has
within a moment been broken by the words of their Master,
&ldquo;One of you shall betray Me.&rdquo; In the agitation of their consciences
and affections, the disciples have started into groups
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>
or clusters along the table, some standing, some still remaining
seated. There are four of these groups, of three disciples each,
and each group is harmoniously interlinked by some natural
connecting action with the next. Leonardo, though no special
student of the Greeks, has perfectly carried out the Greek
principle of expressive variety in particulars subordinated to
general symmetry. He has used all his acquired science of linear
and aerial perspective to create an almost complete illusion
to the eye, but an illusion that has in it nothing trivial, and in
heightening our sense of the material reality of the scene only
heightens its profound spiritual impressiveness and gravity.
The results of his intensest meditations on the psychology and
the human and divine significance of the event (on which he
has left some pregnant hints in written words of his own) are
perfectly fused with those of his subtlest technical calculations
on the rhythmical balancing of groups and arrangement of
figures in space.</p>

<p>Of authentic preparatory studies for this work there remain
but few. There is a sheet at the Louvre of much earlier date
than the first idea or commission for this particular picture,
containing some nude sketches for the arrangement of the
subject; another later and farther advanced, but still probably
anterior to the practical commission, at Venice, and a MS.
sheet of great interest at the Victoria and Albert Museum,
on which the painter has noted in writing the dramatic motives
appropriate to the several disciples. At Windsor and Milan
are a few finished studies in red chalk for the heads. A highly-reputed
series of life-sized chalk drawings of the same heads,
of which the greater portion is at Weimar, consists of early
copies, and is interesting though having no just claim to originality.
Scarcely less doubtful is the celebrated unfinished and
injured study of the head of Christ at the Brera, Milan.</p>

<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s triumph with his &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; encouraged him
in the hope of proceeding now to the casting of the Sforza
monument or &ldquo;Great Horse,&rdquo; the model of which had stood for
the last three years the admiration of all beholders, in the Corte
Vecchio of the Castello. He had formed a new and close friendship
with Luca Pacioli of Borgo San Sepolcro, the great mathematician,
whose <i>Summa de aritmetica</i>, <i>geometrica</i>, &amp;c., he had
eagerly bought at Pavia on its first appearance, and who arrived
at the Court of Milan about the moment of the completion of
the &ldquo;Cenacolo.&rdquo; Pacioli was equally amazed and delighted
at Leonardo&rsquo;s two great achievements in sculpture and painting,
and still more at the genius for mathematical, physical and
anatomical research shown in the collections of MS. notes which
the master laid before him. The two began working together
on the materials for Pacioli&rsquo;s next book, <i>De divina proportione</i>.
Leonardo obtained Pacioli&rsquo;s help in calculations and measurements
for the great task of casting the bronze horse and man.
But he was soon called away by Ludovico to a different undertaking,
the completion of the interior decorations, already
begun by another hand and interrupted, of certain chambers
of the Castello called the <i>Saletta Negra</i> and the <i>Sala Grande
dell&rsquo; Asse</i>, or <i>Sala della Torre</i>. When, in the last decade of the
19th century, works of thorough architectural investigation and
repair were undertaken in that building under the superintendence
of Professor Luca Beltrami, a devoted foreign student,
Dr Paul Müller-Walde, obtained leave to scrape for traces of
Leonardo&rsquo;s handiwork beneath the replastered and white-washed
walls and ceilings of chambers that might be identified
with these. In one small chamber there was cleared a frieze
of cupids intermingled with foliage; but in this, after the first
moments of illusion, it was only possible to acknowledge the
hand of some unknown late and lax decorator of the school,
influenced as much by Raphael as by Leonardo. In another
room (<i>Sala del Tesoro</i>) was recovered a gigantic headless figure,
in all probability of Mercury, also wrongly claimed at first
for Leonardo, and afterwards, to all appearance rightly, for
Bramante. But in the great <i>Sala dell&rsquo; Asse</i> (or <i>della Torre</i>)
abundant traces of Leonardo&rsquo;s own hand were found, in the
shape of a decoration of intricate geometrical knot or plait work
combined with natural leafage; the abstract puzzle-pattern, of
a kind in which Leonardo took peculiar pleasure, intermingling
in cunning play and contrast with a pattern of living boughs
and leaves exquisitely drawn in free and vital growth. Sufficient
portions of this design were found in good preservation to enable
the whole to be accurately restored&mdash;a process as legitimate in
such a case as censurable in the case of a figure-painting. For
these and other artistic labours Leonardo was rewarded in 1498
(ready money being with difficulty forthcoming and his salary
being long in arrears) by the gift of a suburban garden outside
the Porta Vercelli.</p>

<p>But again he could not get leave to complete the task in hand.
He was called away on duty as chief military engineer (<i>ingegnere
camerale</i>) with the special charge of inspecting and maintaining
all the canals and waterways of the duchy. Dangers were accumulating
upon Ludovico and the state of Milan. France had become
Ludovico&rsquo;s enemy; and Louis XII., the pope and Venice had
formed a league to divide his principality among them. He
counted on baffling them by forming a counter league of the
principalities of northern Italy, and by raising the Turks against
Venice, and the Germans and Swiss against France. Germans
and Swiss, however, inopportunely fell to war against each other.
Ludovico travelled to Innsbruck, the better to push his interests
(September 1499). In his absence Louis XII. invaded the
Milanese, and the officers left in charge of the city surrendered
it without striking a blow. The invading sovereign, going to
Sta Maria delle Grazie with his retinue to admire the renowned
painting of the &ldquo;Last Supper,&rdquo; asked if it could not be detached
from the wall and transported to France. The French lieutenant
in Milan, Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, the embittered enemy of
Ludovico, began exercising a vindictive tyranny over the city
which had so long accepted the sway of the usurper. Great
artists were usually exempt from the consequences of political
revolutions, and Trivulzio, now or later, commissioned Leonardo
to design an equestrian monument to himself. Leonardo, having
remained unmolested at Milan for two months under the new
régime, but knowing that Ludovico was preparing a great stroke
for the re-establishment of his power, and that fresh convulsions
must ensue, thought it best to provide for his own security. In
December he left Milan with his friend Luca Pacioli, having first
sent some of his modest savings to Florence for investment.
His intention was to watch events. They took a turn which made
him a stranger to Milan for the next seven years. Ludovico, at
the head of an army of Swiss mercenaries, returned victoriously
in February 1500, and was welcomed by a population disgusted
with the oppression of the invaders. But in April he was once
more overthrown by the French in a battle fought at Novara, his
Swiss clamouring at the last moment for their overdue pay, and
treacherously refusing to fight against a force of their own
countrymen led by La Trémouille. Ludovico was taken prisoner
and carried to France; the city, which had been strictly spared
on the first entry of Louis XII., was entered and sacked; and
the model of Leonardo&rsquo;s great statue made a butt (as eye witnesses
tell) for Gascon archers. Two years later we find the duke Ercole
of Ferrara begging the French king&rsquo;s lieutenant in Milan to let
him have the model, injured as it was, for the adornment of his
own city; but nothing came of the petition, and within a short
time it seems to have been totally broken up.</p>

<p>Thus, of Leonardo&rsquo;s sixteen years&rsquo; work at Milan (1483-1499)
the results actually remaining are as follows: The Louvre
&ldquo;Virgin of the Rocks&rdquo; possibly, <i>i.e.</i> as to its execution; the
conception and style are essentially Florentine, carried out by
Leonardo to a point of intense and almost glittering finish, of
quintessential, almost overstrained, refinement in design and
expression, and invested with a new element of romance by the
landscape in which the scene is set&mdash;a strange watered country
of basaltic caves and arches, with the lights and shadows striking
sharply and yet mysteriously among rocks, some upright, some
jutting, some pendent, all tufted here and there with exquisite
growths of shrub and flower. The National Gallery &ldquo;Virgin of
the Rocks&rdquo; certainly, with help from Ambrogio de Predis; in
this the Florentine character of the original is modified by an
admixture of Milanese elements, the tendency to harshness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span>
over-elaboration of detail softened, the strained action of the
angel&rsquo;s pointing hand altogether dropped, while in many places
pupils&rsquo; work seems recognizable beside that of the master. The
&ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; of Sta Maria delle Grazie, his masterpiece; as to
its history and present condition enough has been said. The
decorations of the ceiling of the Sala della Torre in the Castello.
Other paintings done by him at Milan are mentioned, and
attempts have been made to identify them with works still
existing. He is known to have painted portraits of two of the
king&rsquo;s mistresses, Cecilia Gallerani and Lucrezia Crivelli. Cecilia
Gallerani used to be identified as a lady with ringlets and a lute,
depicted in a portrait at Milan, now rightly assigned to Bartolommeo
Veneto. More lately she has by some been conjecturally
recognized in a doubtful, though Leonardesque, portrait of a
lady with a weasel in the Czartoryski collection at Prague.
Lucrezia Crivelli has, with no better reason, been identified with
the famous &ldquo;Belle Ferronnière&rdquo; (a mere misnomer, caught
from the true name of another portrait which used to hang near
it) at the Louvre; this last is either a genuine Milanese portrait
by Leonardo himself or an extraordinarily fine work of his pupil
Boltraffio. Strong claims have also been made on behalf of a fine
profile portrait resembling Beatrice d&rsquo;Este in the Ambrosiana;
but this the best judges are agreed in regarding as a work,
done in a lucky hour, of Ambrogio de Predis. A portrait of a
musician in the same gallery is in like manner contested between
the master and the pupil. Mention is made of a &ldquo;Nativity&rdquo;
painted for and sent to the emperor Maximilian, and also
apparently of some picture painted for Matthias Corvinus, king
of Hungary; both are lost or at least unidentified. The painters
especially recorded as Leonardo&rsquo;s immediate pupils during this
part of his life at Milan are the two before mentioned, Giovanni
Antonio Boltraffio and Ambrogio Preda or de Predis, with
Marco d&rsquo;Oggionno and Andrea Salai, the last apparently less
a fully-trained painter than a studio assistant and personal
attendant, devotedly attached and faithful in both capacities.
Leonardo&rsquo;s own native Florentine manner had at first been not
a little modified by that of the Milanese school as he found it
represented in the works of such men as Bramantino, Borgognone
and Zenale; but his genius had in its turn reacted far more
strongly upon the younger members of the school, and exercised,
now or later, a transforming and dominating influence not only
upon his immediate pupils, but upon men like Luini, Giampetrino,
Bazzi, Cesare da Sesto and indeed the whole Lombard
school in the early 15th century. Of sculpture done by him
during this period we have no remains, only the tragically
tantalizing history of the Sforza monument. Of drawings there
are very many, including few only for the &ldquo;Last Supper,&rdquo; many
for the Sforza monument, as well as the multitude of sketches,
scientific and other, which we find intermingled among the vast
body of his miscellaneous MSS., notes and records. In mechanical,
scientific and theoretical studies of all kinds it was a period, as
these MSS. attest, of extraordinary activity and self-development.
At Pavia in 1494 we find him taking up literary and
grammatical studies, both in Latin and the vernacular; the
former, no doubt, in order the more easily to read those among the
ancients who had laboured in the fields that were his own, as
Euclid, Galen, Celsus, Ptolemy, Pliny, Vitruvius and, above all,
Archimedes; the latter with a growing hope of some day getting
into proper form and order the mass of materials he was daily
accumulating for treatises on all his manifold subjects of enquiry.
He had been much helped by his opportunities of intercourse
with the great architects, engineers and mathematicians who
frequented the court of Milan&mdash;Bramante, Alberghetti, Andrea
di Ferrara, Pietro Monti, Fazio Cardano and, above all, Luca
Pacioli. The knowledge of Leonardo&rsquo;s position among and
familiarity with such men early helped to spread the idea that
he had been at the head of a regularly constituted academy of
arts and sciences at Milan. The occurrence of the words &ldquo;Achademia
Leonardi Vinci&rdquo; on certain engravings, done after his
drawings, of geometric &ldquo;knots&rdquo; or puzzle-patterns (things for
which we have already learned his partiality), helped to give
currency to this impression not only in Italy but in the North,
where the same engravings were copied by Albrecht Dürer.
The whole notion has been proved mistaken. There existed no
such academy at Milan, with Leonardo as president. The
academies of the day represented the prevailing intellectual
tendency of Renaissance humanism, namely, an absorbing
enthusiasm for classic letters and for the transcendental speculations
of Platonic and neo-Platonic mysticism, not unmixed with
the traditions and practice of medieval alchemy, astrology and
necromantics. For these last pursuits Leonardo had nothing
but contempt. His many-sided and far-reaching studies in
experimental science were mainly his own, conceived and carried
out long in advance of his time, and in communion with only
such more or less isolated spirits as were advancing along one or
another of the same paths of knowledge. He learnt indeed on
these lines eagerly wherever he could, and in learning imparted
knowledge to others. But he had no school in any proper sense
except his studio, and his only scholars were those who painted
there. Of these one or two, as we have evidence, tried their hands
at engraving; among their engravings were these &ldquo;knots,&rdquo;
which, being things of use for decorative craftsmen to copy,
were inscribed for identification, and perhaps for protection, as
coming from the Achademia Leonardi Vinci; a trifling matter
altogether, and quite unfit to sustain the elaborate structure
of conjecture which has been built on it.</p>

<p>To return to the master: when he and Luca Pacioli left Milan
in December 1499, their destination was Venice. They made
a brief stay at Mantua, where Leonardo was graciously received
by the duchess Isabella Gonzaga, the most cultured of the
many cultured great ladies of her time, whose portrait he
promised to paint on a future day; meantime he made the
fine chalk drawing of her now at the Louvre. Arrived at Venice,
he seems to have occupied himself chiefly with studies in mathematics
and cosmography. In April the friends heard of the
second and final overthrow of Ludovico il Moro, and at that
news, giving up all idea of a return to Milan, moved on to Florence,
which they found depressed both by internal troubles and
by the protraction of the indecisive and inglorious war with
Pisa. Here Leonardo undertook to paint an altar-piece for
the Church of the Annunziata, Filippino Lippi, who had already
received the commission, courteously retiring from it in his
favour. A year passed by, and no progress had been made with
the painting. Questions of physical geography and engineering
engrossed him as much as ever. He writes to correspondents
making enquiries about the tides in the Euxine and Caspian Seas.
He reports for the information of the <i>Arte de&rsquo; Mercanti</i> on the
precautions to be taken against a threatening landslip on the
hill of S. Salvatore dell&rsquo; Osservanza. He submits drawings
and models for the canalization and control of the waters of the
Arno, and propounds, with compulsive eloquence and conviction,
a scheme for transporting the Baptistery of St John, the &ldquo;bel
San Giovanni&rdquo; of Dante, to another part of the city, and elevating
it on a stately basement of marble. Meantime the Servite
brothers of the Annunziata were growing impatient for the
completion of their altar-piece. In April 1501 Leonardo had only
finished the cartoon, and this all Florence flocked to see and
admire. Isabella Gonzaga, who cherished the hope that he might
be induced permanently to attach himself to the court of Mantua,
wrote about this time to ask news of him, and to beg for a painting
from him for her study, already adorned with masterpieces
by the first hands of Italy, or at least for a &ldquo;small Madonna,
devout and sweet as is natural to him.&rdquo; In reply her correspondent
says that the master is wholly taken up with geometry
and very impatient of the brush, but at the same time tells
her all about his just completed cartoon for the Annunziata.
The subject was the Virgin seated in the lap of St Anne, bending
forward to hold her child who had half escaped from her embrace
to play with a lamb upon the ground. The description answers
exactly to the composition of the celebrated picture of the
Virgin and St Anne at the Louvre. A cartoon of this composition
in the Esterhazy collection at Vienna is held to be only a copy,
and the original cartoon must be regarded as lost. But another
of kindred though not identical motive has come down to us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span>
and is preserved in the Diploma Gallery at the Royal Academy.
In this incomparable work St Anne, pointing upward with her
left hand, smiles with an intense look of wondering, questioning,
inward sweetness into the face of the Virgin, who in her turn
smiles down upon her child as He leans from her lap to give the
blessing to the little St John standing beside her. Evidently
two different though nearly related designs had been maturing
in Leonardo&rsquo;s mind. A rough first sketch for the motive of the
Academy cartoon is in the British Museum; one for the motive
of the lost cartoon and of the Louvre picture is at Venice. No
painting by Leonardo from the Academy cartoon exists, but in
the Ambrosiana at Milan there is one by Luini, with the figure
of St Joseph added. It remains a matter of debate whether
the Academy cartoon or that shown by Leonardo at the Annunziata
in 1501 was the earlier. The probabilities seem in favour
of the Academy cartoon. This, whether done at Milan or at
Florence, is in any case a typically perfect and harmonious
example of the master&rsquo;s Milanese manner; while in the other
composition with the lamb the action and attitude of the Virgin
are somewhat strained, and the original relation between her head
and her mother&rsquo;s, lovely both in design and expression, is lost.</p>

<p>In spite of the universal praise of his cartoon, Leonardo did
not persevere with the picture, and the monks of the Annunziata
had to give back the commission to Filippino Lippi, at whose
death the task was completed by Perugino. It remains uncertain
whether a small Madonna with distaff and spindle, which
the correspondent of Isabella Gonzaga reports Leonardo as
having begun for one Robertet, a favourite of the king of France,
was ever finished. He painted one portrait, it is said, at this
time, that of Ginevra Benci, a kinswoman, perhaps sister, of
a youth Giovanni di Amerigo Benci, who shared his passion
for cosmographical studies; and probably began another,
the famous &ldquo;La Gioconda,&rdquo; which was only finished four years
afterwards. The gonfalionere Soderini offered him in vain,
to do with it what he would, the huge half-spoiled block of
marble out of which Michelangelo three years later wrought his
&ldquo;David.&rdquo; Isabella Gonzaga again begged, in an autograph
letter, that she might have a painting by his hand, but her request
was put off; he did her, however, one small service by examining
and reporting on some jewelled vases, formerly the property of
Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici, which had been offered her. The importunate
expectations of a masterpiece or masterpieces in painting
or sculpture, which beset him on all hands in Florence, inclined
him to take service again with some princely patron, if possible
of a genius commensurate with his own, who would give him
scope to carry out engineering schemes on a vast scale. Accordingly
he suddenly took service, in the spring of 1502, with
Cesare Borgia, duke of Valentinois, then almost within sight of
the realization of his huge ambitions, and meanwhile occupied
in consolidating his recent conquests in the Romagna. Between
May 1502 and March 1503 Leonardo travelled as chief engineer
to Duke Caesar over a great part of central Italy. Starting
with a visit to Piombino, on the coast opposite Elba, he went
by way of Siena to Urbino, where he made drawings and
began works; was thence hastily summoned by way of Pesaro
and Rimini to Cesena; spent two months between there and
Cesenatico, projecting and directing canal and harbour works,
and planning the restoration of the palace of Frederic II.; thence
hurriedly joined his master, momentarily besieged by enemies
at Imola; followed him probably to Sinigaglia and Perugia,
through the whirl of storms and surprises, vengeances and
treasons, which marked his course that winter, and finally, by
way of Chiusi and Acquapendente, as far as Orvieto and probably
to Rome, where Caesar arrived on the 14th of February 1503.
The pope&rsquo;s death and Caesar&rsquo;s own downfall were not destined
to be long delayed. But Leonardo apparently had already had
enough of that service, and was back at Florence in March. He
has left dated notes and drawings made at most of the stations
we have named, besides a set of six large-scale maps drawn
minutely with his own hand, and including nearly the whole
territory of the Maremma, Tuscany and Umbria between the
Apennines and the Tyrrhene Sea.</p>

<p>At Florence he was at last persuaded, on the initiative of
Piero Soderini, to undertake for his native city a work of painting
as great as that with which he had adorned Milan. This was
a battle-piece to decorate one of the walls of the new council-hall
in the palace of the signory. He chose an episode in the
victory won by the generals of the republic in 1440 over Niccolo
Piccinino near a bridge at Anghiari, in the upper valley of the
Tiber. To the young Michelangelo was presently entrusted a
rival battle-piece to be painted on another wall of the same
apartment; he chose, as is well known, a surprise of the Florentine
forces in the act of bathing near Pisa. About the same
time Leonardo took part in the debate on the proper site for
Michelangelo&rsquo;s newly finished colossal &ldquo;David,&rdquo; and voted
in favour of the Loggia dei Lanzi, against a majority which
included Michelangelo himself. Neither Leonardo&rsquo;s genius nor
his noble manners could soften the rude and taunting temper
of the younger man, whose style as an artist, nevertheless, in
subjects both of tenderness and terror, underwent at this time
a profound modification from Leonardo&rsquo;s example.</p>

<p>In one of the sections of his projected <i>Treatise on Painting</i>,
Leonardo has detailed at length, and obviously from his own
observation, the pictorial aspects of a battle. His choice of
subject in this instance was certainly not made from any love
of warfare or indifference to its horrors. In his MSS. there
occur almost as many trenchant sayings on life and human
affairs as on art and natural law; and of war he has disposed
in two words as a &ldquo;bestial frenzy&rdquo; (<i>pazzia bestialissima</i>). In
his design for the Hall of Council he set himself to depict this
frenzy at its fiercest. He chose the moment of a terrific struggle
for the colours between the opposing sides; hence the work
became commonly known as the &ldquo;Battle of the Standard.&rdquo;
Judging by the accounts of those who saw it, and the fragmentary
evidences which remain, the tumultuous medley of men and
horses, and the expressions of martial fury and despair, must
have been conceived and rendered with a mastery not less
commanding than had been the looks and gestures of bodeful
sorrow and soul&rsquo;s perplexity among the quiet company on the
convent wall at Milan. The place assigned to Leonardo for
the preparation of his cartoon was the Sala del Papa at Santa
Maria Novella. He for once worked steadily and unremittingly
at his task. His accounts with the signory enable us to follow
its progress step by step. He had finished the cartoon in less
than two years (1504-1505), and when it was exhibited along
with that of Michelangelo, the two rival works seemed to all
men a new revelation of the powers of art, and served as a model
and example of the students of that generation, as the frescoes
of Masaccio in the Carmine had served to those of two generations
earlier. The young Raphael, whose incomparable instinct for
rhythmical design had been trained hitherto on subjects of
holy quietude and rapt contemplation according to the traditions
of Umbrian art, learnt from Leonardo&rsquo;s example to apply the
same instinct to themes of violent action and strife. From
the same example Fra Bartolommeo and a crowd of other
Florentine painters of the rising or risen generation took in like
manner a new impulse. The master lost no time in proceeding
to the execution of his design upon the mural surface; this
time he had devised a technical method of which, after a preliminary
trial in the Sala del Papa, he regarded the success as
certain; the colours, whether tempera or other remains in
doubt, were to be laid on a specially prepared ground, and then
both colours and ground made secure upon the wall by the
application of heat. When the central group was done the heat
was applied, but it was found to take effect unequally; the
colours in the upper part ran or scaled from the wall, and the
result was a failure more or less complete. The unfinished
and decayed painting remained for some fifty years on the wall,
but after 1560 was covered over with new frescoes by Vasari.
The cartoon did not last so long. After doing its work as the
most inspiring of all examples for students it seems to have been
cut up. When Leonardo left Italy for good in 1516 he is recorded
to have left &ldquo;the greater part of it&rdquo; in deposit at the hospital
of S. Maria Nuova, where he was accustomed also to deposit his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
moneys, and whence it seems before long to have disappeared.
Our only existing memorials of the great work are a number of
small pen-studies of fighting men and horses, three splendid
studies in red chalk at Budapest for heads in the principal
group, one head at Oxford copied by a contemporary of the size
of the original cartoon (above life); a tiny sketch, also at
Oxford, by Raphael after the principal group; an engraving
done by Zacchia of Lucca in 1558 not after the original but
after a copy; a 16th-century Flemish drawing of the principal
group, and another, splendidly spirited, by Rubens, both copies
of copies; with Edelinck&rsquo;s fine engraving after the Rubens
drawing.</p>

<p>During these years, 1503-1506, Leonardo also resumed (if
it is true that he had already begun it before his travels with
Cesare Borgia) the portrait of Madonna Lisa, the Neapolitan
wife of Zanobi del Giocondo, and finished it to the last pitch
of his powers. In this lady he had found a sitter whose face
and smile possessed in a singular degree the haunting, enigmatic
charm in which he delighted. He worked, it is said, at her
portrait during some portion of four successive years, causing
music to be played during the sittings that the rapt expression
might not fade from off her countenance. The picture was bought
afterwards by Francis I. for four thousand gold florins, and is
now one of the glories of the Louvre. The richness of colouring
on which Vasari expatiates has indeed flown, partly from
injury, partly because in striving for effects of light and shade
the painter was accustomed to model his figures on a dark
ground, and in this as in his other oil-pictures the ground has
to a large extent come through. Nevertheless, in its dimmed
and blackened state, the portrait casts an irresistible spell alike
by subtlety of expression, by refinement and precision of drawing,
and by the romantic invention of its background. It has been
the theme of endless critical rhapsodies, among which that of
Pater is perhaps the most imaginative as it is the best known.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1506 Leonardo, moved perhaps by chagrin
at the failure of his work in the Hall of Council, accepted a
pressing invitation to Milan, from Charles d&rsquo;Amboise, Maréchal
de Chaumont, the lieutenant of the French king in Lombardy.
The leave of absence granted to him by the signory on the
request of the French viceroy was for three months only. The
period was several times extended, at first grudgingly, Soderini
complaining that Leonardo had treated the republic ill in the
matter of the battle picture; whereupon the painter honourably
offered to refund the money paid, an offer which the signory
as honourably refused. Louis XII. sent messages urgently
desiring that Leonardo should await his own arrival in Milan,
having seen a small Madonna by him in France (probably
that painted for Robertet) and hoping to obtain from him works
of the same class and perhaps a portrait. The king arrived
in May 1507, and soon afterwards Leonardo&rsquo;s services were
formally and amicably transferred from the signory of Florence
to Louis, who gave him the title of painter and engineer in
ordinary. In September of the same year troublesome private
affairs called him to Florence. His father had died in 1504,
apparently intestate. After his death Leonardo experienced
unkindness from his seven half-brothers, Ser Piero&rsquo;s legitimate
sons. They were all much younger than himself. One of them,
who followed his father&rsquo;s profession, made himself the champion
of the others in disputing Leonardo&rsquo;s claim to his share, first
in the paternal inheritance, and then in that which had been
left to be divided between the brothers and sisters by an uncle.
The litigation that ensued dragged on for several years, and
forced upon Leonardo frequent visits to Florence and interruptions
of his work at Milan, in spite of pressing letters to the
authorities of the republic from Charles d&rsquo;Amboise, from the
French king himself, and from others of his powerful friends
and patrons, begging that the proceedings might be accelerated.
There are traces of work done during these intervals of compulsory
residence at Florence. A sheet of sketches drawn there
in 1508 shows the beginning of a Madonna now lost except in
the form of copies, one of which (known as the &ldquo;Madonna
Litta&rdquo;) is at St Petersburg, another in the Poldi-Pezzoli Museum
at Milan. A letter from Leonardo to Charles d&rsquo;Amboise in 1511,
announcing the end of his law troubles, speaks of two Madonnas
of different sizes that he means to bring with him to Milan. One
was no doubt that just mentioned; can the other have been
the Louvre &ldquo;Virgin with St Anne and St John,&rdquo; now at last
completed from the cartoon exhibited in 1501? Meantime the
master&rsquo;s main home and business were at Milan. Few works
of painting and none of sculpture (unless the unfulfilled commission
for the Trivulzio monument belongs to this time) are
recorded as occupying him during the seven years of his second
residence in that city (1506-1513). He had attached to himself
a new and devoted young friend and pupil of noble birth,
Francesco Melzi. At the villa of the Melzi family at Vaprio,
where Leonardo was a frequent visitor, a colossal Madonna on
one of the walls is traditionally ascribed to him, but is rather
the work of Sodoma or of Melzi himself working under the
master&rsquo;s eye. Another painter in the service of the French king,
Jehan Perréal or Jehan de Paris, visited Milan, and consultations
on technical points were held between him and Leonardo. But
Leonardo&rsquo;s chief practical employments were evidently on the
continuation of his great hydraulic and irrigation works in
Lombardy. His old trivial office of pageant-master and inventor
of scientific toys was revived on the occasion of Louis XII.&rsquo;s
triumphal entry after the victory of Agnadello in 1509, and gave
intense delight to the French retinue of the king. He was
consulted on the construction of new choir-stalls for the cathedral.
He laboured in the natural sciences as ardently as ever, especially
at anatomy in company with the famous professor of Pavia,
Marcantonio della Torre. To about this time, when he was
approaching his sixtieth year, may belong the noble portrait-drawing
of himself in red chalk at Turin. He looks too old for
his years, but quite unbroken; the character of a veteran sage
has fully imprinted itself on his countenance; the features are
grand, clear and deeply lined, the mouth firmly set and almost
stern, the eyes strong and intent beneath their bushy eyebrows,
the hair flows untrimmed over his shoulders and commingles
with a majestic beard.</p>

<p>Returning to Milan with his law-suits ended in 1511, Leonardo
might have looked forward to an old age of contented labour,
the chief task of which, had he had his will, would undoubtedly
have been to put in order the vast mass of observations and
speculations accumulated in his note-books, and to prepare
some of them for publication. But as his star seemed rising
that of his royal protector declined. The hold of the French
on Lombardy was rudely shaken by hostile political powers,
then confirmed again for a while by the victories of Gaston de
Foix, and finally destroyed by the battle in which that hero fell
under the walls of Ravenna. In June 1512 a coalition between
Spain, Venice and the pope re-established the Sforza dynasty
in power at Milan in the person of Ludovico&rsquo;s son Massimiliano.
This prince must have been familiar with Leonardo as a
child, but perhaps resented the ready transfer of his allegiance
to the French, and at any rate gave him no employment.
Within a few months the ageing master uprooted himself from
Milan, and moved with his chattels and retinue of pupils to
Rome, into the service of the house that first befriended him,
the Medici. The vast enterprises of Pope Julius II. had already
made Rome the chief seat and centre of Italian art. The accession
of Giulio de&rsquo; Medici in 1513 under the title of Leo X. raised
on all hands hopes of still ampler and more sympathetic patronage.
Leonardo&rsquo;s special friend at the papal court was the pope&rsquo;s
youngest brother, Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici, a youth who combined
dissipated habits with thoughtful culture and a genuine interest
in arts and sciences. By his influence Leonardo and his train
were accommodated with apartments in the Belvedere of the
Vatican. But the conditions of the time and place proved
adverse. The young generation held the field. Michelangelo
and Raphael, who had both, as we have seen, risen to greatness
partly on Leonardo&rsquo;s shoulders, were fresh from the glory of
their great achievements in the Sistine Chapel and the Stanze.
Their rival factions hated each other, but both, especially the
faction of Michelangelo, turned bitterly against the veteran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span>
newcomer. The pope, indeed, is said to have been delighted
with Leonardo&rsquo;s minor experiments and ingenuities in science,
and especially by a kind of zoological toys which he had invented
by way of pastime, as well as mechanical tricks played upon
living animals. But for the master&rsquo;s graver researches and
projects he cared little, and was far more interested in the
dreams of astrologers and alchemists. When Leonardo, having
received a commission for a picture, was found distilling for
himself a new medium of oils and herbs before he had begun the
design, the pope was convinced, not quite unreasonably, that
nothing serious would come of it. The only paintings positively
recorded as done by him at Rome are two small panels for an
official of the papal court, one of a child, the other of a Madonna,
both now lost or unrecognized. To this time may also belong
a lost Leda, standing upright with the god in swan&rsquo;s guise at her
side and the four children near their feet. This picture was
at Fontainebleau in the 16th century and is known from several
copies, the finest of them at the Borghese gallery, as well as
from one or two preliminary sketches by the master himself
and a small sketch copy by Raphael. A portrait of a Florentine
lady, said to have been painted for Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici and seen
afterwards in France, may also have been done at Rome; or
may what we learn of this be only a confused account of the Monna
Lisa? Tradition ascribes to Leonardo an attractive fresco of
a Madonna with a donor in the convent of St Onofrio, but this
seems to be clearly the work of Boltraffio. The only engineering
works we hear of at this time are some on the harbour and
defences of Cività Vecchia. On the whole the master in these
Roman days found himself slighted for the first and only time
in his life. He was, moreover, plagued by insubordination and
malignity on the part of two German assistant craftsmen lodged
in his apartments. Charges of impiety and body-snatching laid
by these men in connexion with his anatomical studies caused
the favour of the pope to be for a time withdrawn. After a
stay of less than two years, Leonardo left Rome under the following
circumstances. Louis XII. of France had died in the last
days of 1514. His young and brilliant successor, Francis I.,
surprised Europe by making a sudden dash at the head of an
army across the Alps to vindicate his rights in Italy. After
much hesitation Leo X. in the summer of 1515 ordered Giuliano
de&rsquo; Medici, as gonfalonier of the Church, to lead a papal
force into the Emilia and watch the movements of the invader.
Leonardo accompanied his protector on the march, and remained
with the headquarters of the papal army at Piacenza when
Giuliano fell ill and retired to Florence. After the battle of
Marignano it was arranged that Francis and the pope should
meet in December at Bologna. The pope, travelling by way
of Florence and discussing there the great new scheme of the
Laurentian library, entertained the idea of giving the commission
to Leonardo; but Michelangelo came in hot haste from
Rome and succeeded in securing it for himself. As the time
for the meeting of the potentates at Bologna drew near, Leonardo
proceeded thither from Piacenza, and in due course was presented
to the king. Between the brilliant young sovereign
and the grand old sage an immediate and strong sympathy
sprang up; Leonardo accompanied Francis on his homeward
march as far as Milan, and there determined to accept the
royal invitation to France, where a new home was offered him
with every assurance of honour and regard.</p>

<p>The remaining two and a half years of Leonardo&rsquo;s life were
spent at the Castle of Cloux near Amboise, which was assigned,
with a handsome pension, to his use. The court came often
to Amboise, and the king delighted in his company, declaring
his knowledge both of the fine arts and of philosophy to be
beyond those of all mortal men. In the spring of 1518 Leonardo
had occasion to exercise his old talents as a festival-master when
the dauphin was christened and a Medici-Bourbon marriage
celebrated. He drew the designs for a new palace at Amboise,
and was much engaged with the project of a great canal to connect
the Loire and Saône. An ingenious attempt has been made
to prove, in the absence of records, that the famous spiral
staircase at Blois was also of his designing.</p>

<p>Among his visitors was a fellow-countryman, Cardinal Louis
of Aragon, whose secretary has left an account of the day.
Leonardo, it seems, was suffering from some form of slight
paralysis which impaired his power of hand. But he showed
the cardinal three pictures, the portrait of a Florentine lady
done for Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici (the Gioconda?), the Virgin in the
lap of St Anne (the Louvre picture; finished at Florence or
Milan 1507-1513?), and a youthful John the Baptist. The
last, which may have been done since he settled in France, is
the darkened and partly repainted, but still powerful and
haunting half-length figure in the Louvre, with the smile of
inward ravishment and the prophetic finger beckoning skyward
like that of St Anne in the Academy cartoon. Of the &ldquo;Pomona&rdquo;
mentioned by Lomazzo as a work of the Amboise time his
visitor says nothing, nor yet of the Louvre &ldquo;Bacchus,&rdquo; which
tradition ascribes to Leonardo but which is clearly pupil&rsquo;s work.
Besides pictures, the master seems also to have shown and
explained to his visitors some of his vast store of notes and
observations on anatomy and physics. He kept hoping to get
some order among his papers, the accumulation of more than
forty years, and perhaps to give the world some portion of the
studies they contained. But his strength was nearly exhausted.
On Easter Eve 1519, feeling that the end was near, he made his
will. It made provision, as became a great servant of the most
Christian king, for masses to be said and candles to be offered
in three different churches of Amboise, first among them that
of St Florentin, where he desired to be buried, as well as for
sixty poor men to serve as torch-bearers at his funeral. Vasari
babbles of a death-bed conversion and repentance. But Leonardo
had never been either a friend or an enemy of the Church.
Sometimes, indeed, he denounces fiercely enough the arts and
pretensions of priests; but no one has embodied with such
profound spiritual insight some of the most vital moments of
the Christian story. His insatiable researches into natural fact
brought upon him among the vulgar some suspicion of practising
those magic arts which of all things he scouted and despised.
The bent of his mind was all towards the teachings of experience
and against those of authority, and laws of nature certainly
occupied far more of his thoughts than dogmas of religion;
but when he mentions these it is with respect as throwing light
on the truth of things from a side which was not his own. His
conformity at the end had in it nothing contradictory of his
past. He received the sacraments of the Church and died on
the 2nd of May 1519. King Francis, then at his court of St
Germain-en-Laye, is said to have wept for the loss of such a
servant; that he was present beside the death-bed and held
the dying painter in his arms is a familiar but an untrue tale.
After a temporary sepulture elsewhere his remains were transported
on the 12th of August to the cloister of St Florentin
according to his wish. He left all his MSS. and apparently all
the contents of his studio, with other gifts, to the devoted Melzi,
whom he named executor; to Salai and to his servant Battista
Villanis a half each of his vineyard outside Milan; gifts of
money and clothes to his maid Maturina; one of money to the
poor of the hospital in Amboise; and to his unbrotherly half-brothers
a sum of four hundred ducats lying to his credit at
Florence.</p>

<p>History tells of no man gifted in the same degree as Leonardo
was at once for art and science. In art he was an inheritor and
perfecter, born in a day of great and many-sided endeavours on
which he put the crown, surpassing both predecessors and
contemporaries. In science, on the other hand, he was a pioneer,
working wholly for the future, and in great part alone. That the
two stupendous gifts should in some degree neutralize each other
was inevitable. No imaginable strength of any single man would
have sufficed to carry out a hundredth part of what Leonardo
essayed. The mere attempt to conquer the kingdom of light
and shade for the art of painting was destined to tax the skill of
generations, and is perhaps not wholly and finally accomplished
yet. Leonardo sought to achieve that conquest and at the same
time to carry the old Florentine excellences of linear drawing
and psychological expression to a perfection of which other men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
had not dreamed. The result, though marvellous in quality, is
in quantity lamentably meagre. Knowing and doing allured him
equally, and in art, which consists in doing, his efforts were often
paralysed by his strained desire to know. The thirst for knowledge
had first been aroused in him by the desire of perfecting
the images of beauty and power which it was his business to
create.</p>

<p>Thence there grew upon him the passion of knowledge for its
own sake. In the splendid balance of his nature the Virgilian
longing, <i>rerum cognoscere causas</i>, could never indeed wholly
silence the call to exercise his active powers. But the powers he
cared most to exercise ceased by degree to be those of imaginative
creation, and came to be those of turning to practical human
use the mastery which his studies had taught him over the forces
of nature. In science he was the first among modern men to set
himself most of those problems which unnumbered searchers of
later generations have laboured severally or in concert to solve.
Florence had had other sons of comprehensive genius, artistic
and mechanical, Leon Battista Alberti perhaps the chief. But
the more the range and character of Leonardo&rsquo;s studies becomes
ascertained the more his greatness dwarfs them all. A hundred
years before Bacon, say those who can judge best, he showed a
firmer grasp of the principles of experimental science than Bacon
showed, fortified by a far wider range of actual experiment and
observation. Not in his actual conclusions, though many of
these point with surprising accuracy in the direction of truths
established by later generations, but in the soundness, the wisdom,
the tenacity of his methods lies his great title to glory. Had the
Catholic reaction not fatally discouraged the pursuit of the natural
sciences in Italy, had Leonardo even left behind him any one with
zeal and knowledge enough to extract from the mass of his MSS.
some portion of his labours in those sciences and give them to
the world, an incalculable impulse would have been given to all
those enquiries by which mankind has since been striving to
understand the laws of its being and control the conditions of
its environment,&mdash;to mathematics and astronomy, to mechanics,
hydraulics, and physics generally, to geology, geography, and
cosmology, to anatomy and the sciences of life. As it was, these
studies of Leonardo&mdash;&ldquo;studies intense of strong and stern
delight&rdquo;&mdash;seemed to his trivial followers and biographers merely
his whims and fancies, <i>ghiribizzi</i>, things to be spoken of slightingly
and with apology. The MSS., with the single exception of some
of those relating to painting, lay unheeded and undivulged until
the present generation; and it is only now that the true range of
Leonardo&rsquo;s powers is beginning to be fully discerned.</p>

<p>So much for the intellectual side of Leonardo&rsquo;s character and
career. As a moral being we are less able to discern what he
was like. The man who carried in his brain so many images of
subtle beauty, as well as so much of the hidden science of the
future, must have lived spiritually, in the main, alone. Of
things communicable he was at the same time, as we have said,
communicative&mdash;a genial companion, a generous and loyal
friend, ready and eloquent of discourse, impressing all with whom
he was brought in contact by the power and the charm of genius,
and inspiring fervent devotion and attachment in friends and
pupils. We see him living on terms of constant affection with
his father, and in disputes with his brothers not the aggressor but
the sufferer from aggression. We see him full of tenderness to
animals, a virtue not common in Italy in spite of the example
of St Francis; open-handed in giving, not eager in getting&mdash;&ldquo;poor,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;is the man of many wants&rdquo;; not prone to
resentment&mdash;&ldquo;the best shield against injustice is to double the
cloak of long-suffering&rdquo;; zealous in labour above all men&mdash;&ldquo;as
a day well spent gives joyful sleep, so does a life well spent give
joyful death.&rdquo; With these instincts and maxims, and with his
strength, granting it almost more than human, spent ever tunnelling
in abstruse mines of knowledge, his moral experience is not
likely to have been deeply troubled. In religion, he regarded
the faith of his age and country at least with imaginative sympathy
and intellectual acquiescence, if no more. On the political
storms which shook his country and drove him from one employment
to another, he seems to have looked not with the passionate
participation of a Dante or a Michelangelo but rather with the
serene detachment of a Goethe. In matters of the heart, if any
consoling or any disturbing passion played a great part in his
life, we do not know it; we know only (apart from a few passing
shadows cast by calumny and envy) of affectionate and dignified
relations with friends, patrons and pupils, of public and private
regard mixed in the days of his youth with dazzled admiration,
and in those of his age with something of reverential awe.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>The Drawings of Leonardo.</i>&mdash;These are among the greatest treasures
ever given to the world by the human spirit expressing itself in pen
and pencil. Apart from the many hundreds of illustrative pen-sketches
scattered through his autobiographic and scientific MSS.,
the principal collection is at Windsor Castle (partly derived from
the Arundel collection); others of importance are in the British
Museum; at Christ Church, Oxford; in the Louvre, at Chantilly,
in the Uffizi, the Venice Academy, the Royal Library at Turin, the
Museum of Budapest, and in the collections of M. Bonnat, Mrs Mond,
and Captain Holford. Leonardo&rsquo;s chief implements were pen, silver-point,
and red and black chalk (red chalk especially). In silver-point
there are many beautiful drawings of his earlier time, and some
of his later; but of the charming heads of women and young men
in this material attributed to him in various collections, comparatively
few are his own work, the majority being drawings in his
spirit by his pupils Ambrogio Preda or Boltraffio. Leonardo appears
to have been left-handed. There is some doubt on the point; but
a contemporary and intimate friend, Luca Pacioli, speaks of his
&ldquo;ineffable left hand&rdquo;; all the best of his drawings are shaded
downward from left to right, which would be the readiest way for
a left-handed man; and his habitual eccentric practice of writing
from right to left is much more likely to have been due to natural
left-handedness than to any desire of mystery or concealment. A
full critical discussion and catalogue of the extant drawings of
Leonardo are to be found in Berenson&rsquo;s <i>Drawings of the Florentine
Painters</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Writings of Leonardo.</i>&mdash;The only printed book bearing
Leonardo&rsquo;s name until the recent issues of transcripts from his MSS.
was the celebrated <i>Treatise on Painting</i> (<i>Trattato della pittura, Traité
de la peinture</i>). This consists of brief didactic chapters, or more
properly paragraphs, of practical direction or critical remark on all
the branches and conditions of a painter&rsquo;s practice. The original
MS. draft of Leonardo has been lost, though a great number of notes
for it are scattered through the various extant volumes of his MSS.
The work has been printed in two different forms; one of these
is an abridged version consisting of 365 sections; the first edition
of it was published in Paris in 1551, by Raphael Dufresne, from a
MS. which he found in the Barberini library; the last, translated into
English by J. F. Rigaud, in London, 1877. The other is a more
extended version, in 912 sections, divided into eight books; this
was printed in 1817 by Guglielmo Manzi at Rome, from two MSS.
which he had discovered in the Vatican library; a German translation
from the same MS. has been edited by G. H. Ludwig in Eitelberger&rsquo;s
series of <i>Quellenschriften für Kunstgeschichte</i> (Vienna, 1882;
Stuttgart, 1885). On the history of the book in general see Max
Jordan, <i>Das Malerbuch des Leonardo da Vinci</i> (Leipzig, 1873). The
unknown compilers of the Vatican MSS. must have had before them
much more of Leonardo&rsquo;s original text than is now extant. Only
about a quarter of the total number of paragraphs are identical with
passages to be found in the master&rsquo;s existing autograph note-books.
It is indeed doubtful whether Leonardo himself ever completed
the MS. treatise (or treatises) on painting and kindred subjects
mentioned by Fra Luca Pacioli and by Vasari, and probable that
the form and order, and perhaps some of the substance, of the
<i>Trattato</i> as we have it was due to compilers and not to the master
himself.</p>

<p>In recent years a whole body of scholars and editors have been
engaged in giving to the world the texts of Leonardo&rsquo;s existing
MSS. The history of these is too complicated to be told here in
any detail. Francesco Melzi (d. 1570) kept the greater part of his
master&rsquo;s bequest together as a sacred trust as long as he lived,
though even in his time some MSS. on the art of painting seem to
have passed into other hands. But his descendants suffered the
treasure to be recklessly dispersed. The chief agents in their dispersal
were the Doctor Orazio Melzi who possessed them in the last quarter
of the 16th century; the members of a Milanese family called
Mazzenta, into whose hands they passed in Orazio Melzi&rsquo;s lifetime;
and the sculptor Pompeo Leoni, who at one time entertained the
design of procuring their presentation to Philip II. of Spain, and
who cut up a number of the note-books to form the great miscellaneous
single volume called the <i>Codice Atlantico</i>, now at Milan. This
volume, with a large proportion of the total number of other Leonardo
MSS. then existing, passed into the hands of a Count Arconati, who
presented them to the Ambrosian library at Milan in 1636. In
the meantime the earl of Arundel had made a vain attempt to
purchase one of these volumes (the <i>Codice Atlantico</i>?) at a great
price for the king of England. Some stray parts of the collection,
including the MSS. now at Windsor, did evidently come into Lord
Arundel&rsquo;s possession, and the history of some other parts can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>
followed; while much, it is evident, was lost for good. In 1796
Napoleon swept away to Paris, along with the other art treasures
of Italy, the whole of the Leonardo MSS. at the Ambrosiana:
only the <i>Codice Atlantico</i> was afterwards restored, the other volumes
remaining the property of the Institut de France. These also have
had their adventures, two of them having been stolen by Count
Libri and passed temporarily into the collection of Lord Ashburnham,
whence they were in recent years made over again to the Institute.
The first important step towards a better knowledge of the MSS.
was made by the beginning, in 1880, of the great series of publications
from the MSS. of the Institut de France undertaken by C. Ravaisson-Mollien;
the next by the publication in 1883 of Dr J. P. Richter&rsquo;s
<i>Literary Works of Leonardo da Vinci</i> (see Bibliography): this work
included, besides a history and analytical index of the MSS., facsimiles
of a number of selected pages containing matter of autobiographical,
artistic, or literary interest, with transcripts and
translations of their MS. contexts. Since then much progress has
been made in the publication of the complete MSS., scientific and
other, whether with adequate critical apparatus or in the form of
mere facsimile without transliteration or comment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEONARDO OF PISA<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Leonardus Pisanus</span> or <span class="sc">Fibonacci</span>),
Italian mathematician of the 13th century. Of his personal
history few particulars are known. His father was called
Bonaccio, most probably a nickname with the ironical meaning
of &ldquo;a good, stupid fellow,&rdquo; while to Leonardo himself another
nickname, Bigollone (dunce, blockhead), seems to have been
given. The father was secretary in one of the numerous factories
erected on the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean
by the warlike and enterprising merchants of Pisa. Leonardo
was educated at Bugia, and afterwards toured the Mediterranean.
In 1202 he was again in Italy and published his great work,
<i>Liber abaci</i>, which probably procured him access to the learned
and refined court of the emperor Frederick II. Leonardo
certainly was in relation with some persons belonging to that
circle when he published in 1220 another more extensive work,
<i>De practica geometriae</i>, which he dedicated to the imperial
astronomer Dominicus Hispanus. Some years afterwards
(perhaps in 1228) Leonardo dedicated to the well-known astrologer
Michael Scott the second edition of his <i>Liber abaci</i>, which
was printed with Leonardo&rsquo;s other works by Prince Bald.
Boncompagni (Rome, 1857-1862, 2 vols.). The other works
consist of the <i>Practica geometriae</i> and some most striking
papers of the greatest scientific importance, amongst which the
<i>Liber quadratorum</i> may be specially signalized. It bears the
notice that the author wrote it in 1225, and in the introduction
Leonardo tells us the occasion of its being written. Dominicus
had presented Leonardo to Frederick II. The presentation was
accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance, in which
Leonardo solved several hard problems proposed to him by John
of Palermo, an imperial notary, whose name is met with in
several documents dated between 1221 and 1240. The methods
which Leonardo made use of in solving those problems fill the
<i>Liber quadratorum</i>, the <i>Flos</i>, and a <i>Letter to Magister Theodore</i>.
All these treatises seem to have been written nearly at the same
period, and certainly before the publication of the second edition
of the <i>Liber abaci</i>, in which the <i>Liber quadratorum</i> is expressly
mentioned. We know nothing of Leonardo&rsquo;s fate after he issued
that second edition.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s works are mainly developments of the results obtained
by his predecessors; the influences of Greek, Arabian, and Indian
mathematicians may be clearly discerned in his methods. In his
<i>Practica geometriae</i> plain traces of the use of the Roman <i>agrimensores</i>
are met with; in his <i>Liber abaci</i> old Egyptian problems reveal
their origin by the reappearance of the very numbers in which the
problem is given, though one cannot guess through what channel
they came to Leonardo&rsquo;s knowledge. Leonardo cannot be regarded
as the inventor of that very great variety of truths for which he
mentions no earlier source.</p>

<p>The <i>Liber abaci</i>, which fills 459 printed pages, contains the most
perfect methods of calculating with whole numbers and with fractions,
practice, extraction of the square and cube roots, proportion,
chain rule, finding of proportional parts, averages, progressions, even
compound interest, just as in the completest mercantile arithmetics
of our days. They teach further the solution of problems leading to
equations of the first and second degree, to determinate and indeterminate
equations, not by single and double position only, but
by real algebra, proved by means of geometric constructions, and
including the use of letters as symbols for known numbers, the
unknown quantity being called <i>res</i> and its square <i>census</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>455</span></p>

<p>The second work of Leonardo, his <i>Practica geometriae</i> (1220)
requires readers already acquainted with Euclid&rsquo;s planimetry, who
are able to follow rigorous demonstrations and feel the necessity for
them. Among the contents of this book we simply mention a trigonometrical
chapter, in which the words <i>sinus versus arcus</i> occur, the
approximate extraction of cube roots shown more at large than in
the <i>Liber abaci</i>, and a very curious problem, which nobody would
search for in a geometrical work, viz.&mdash;To find a square number
remaining so after the addition of 5. This problem evidently
suggested the first question, viz.&mdash;To find a square number which
remains a square after the addition and subtraction of 5, put to our
mathematician in presence of the emperor by John of Palermo,
who, perhaps, was quite enough Leonardo&rsquo;s friend to set him such
problems only as he had himself asked for. Leonardo gave as solution
the numbers 11<span class="spp">97</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">144</span>, 16<span class="spp">97</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">144</span>, and 6<span class="spp">97</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">144</span>,&mdash;the squares of 3<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>, 4<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span> and
2<span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>; and the method of finding them is given in the <i>Liber quadratorum</i>.
We observe, however, that this kind of problem was not
new. Arabian authors already had found three square numbers of
equal difference, but the difference itself had not been assigned in
proposing the question. Leonardo&rsquo;s method, therefore, when the
difference was a fixed condition of the problem, was necessarily very
different from the Arabian, and, in all probability, was his own
discovery. The <i>Flos</i> of Leonardo turns on the second question set
by John of Palermo, which required the solution of the cubic equation
x<span class="sp">3</span> + 2x<span class="sp">2</span> + 10x = 20. Leonardo, making use of fractions of the
sexagesimal scale, gives x = 1<span class="sp">0</span> 22<span class="sp">i</span> 7<span class="sp">ii</span> 42<span class="sp">iii</span> 33<span class="sp">iv</span> 4<span class="sp">v</span> 40<span class="sp">vi</span>, after having
demonstrated, by a discussion founded on the 10th book of Euclid,
that a solution by square roots is impossible. It is much to be
deplored that Leonardo does not give the least intimation how he
found his approximative value, outrunning by this result more than
three centuries. Genocchi believes Leonardo to have been in possession
of a certain method called <i>regula aurea</i> by H. Cardan in the
16th century, but this is a mere hypothesis without solid foundation.
In the <i>Flos</i> equations with negative values of the unknown quantity
are also to be met with, and Leonardo perfectly understands the
meaning of these negative solutions. In the <i>Letter to Magister
Theodore</i> indeterminate problems are chiefly worked, and Leonardo
hints at his being able to solve by a general method any problem
of this kind not exceeding the first degree.</p>

<p>As for the influence he exercised on posterity, it is enough to say
that Luca Pacioli, about 1500, in his celebrated <i>Summa</i>, leans so
exclusively to Leonardo&rsquo;s works (at that time known in manuscript
only) that he frankly acknowledges his dependence on them, and
states that wherever no other author is quoted all belongs to
Leonardus Pisanus.</p>

<p><i>Fibonacci&rsquo;s series</i> is a sequence of numbers such that any term is
the sum of the two preceding terms; also known as <i>Lamé&rsquo;s series</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEONCAVALLO, RUGGIERO<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> (1858-&emsp;&emsp;), Italian operatic
composer, was born at Naples and educated for music at the
conservatoire. After some years spent in teaching and in
ineffectual attempts to obtain the production of more than one
opera, his <i>Pagliacci</i> was performed at Milan in 1892 with immediate
success; and next year his <i>Medici</i> was also produced
there. But neither the latter nor <i>Chatterton</i> (1896)&mdash;both early
works&mdash;obtained any favour; and it was not till <i>La Bohème</i>
was performed in 1897 at Venice that his talent obtained public
confirmation. Subsequent operas by Leoncavallo were <i>Zaza</i>
(1900), and <i>Der Roland</i> (1904). In all these operas he was his
own librettist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEONIDAS,<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> king of Sparta, the seventeenth of the Agiad line.
He succeeded, probably in 489 or 488 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, his half-brother
Cleomenes, whose daughter Gorgo he married. In 480 he was
sent with about 7000 men to hold the pass of Thermopylae
against the army of Xerxes. The smallness of the force was,
according to a current story, due to the fact that he was deliberately
going to his doom, an oracle having foretold that Sparta
could be saved only by the death of one of its kings: in reality
it seems rather that the ephors supported the scheme half-heartedly,
their policy being to concentrate the Greek forces at
the Isthmus. Leonidas repulsed the frontal attacks of the
Persians, but when the Malian Ephialtes led the Persian general
Hydarnes by a mountain track to the rear of the Greeks he
divided his army, himself remaining in the pass with 300
Spartiates, 700 Thespians and 400 Thebans. Perhaps he hoped
to surround Hydarnes&rsquo; force: if so, the movement failed, and
the little Greek army, attacked from both sides, was cut down
to a man save the Thebans, who are said to have surrendered.
Leonidas fell in the thickest of the fight; his head was afterwards
cut off by Xerxes&rsquo; order and his body crucified. Our knowledge of
the circumstances <span class="correction" title="amended from it">is</span> too slight to enable us to judge of Leonidas&rsquo;s
strategy, but his heroism and devotion secured him an almost

<p><span class="bold">LEONTIASIS OSSEA,<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> a rare disease characterized by an
overgrowth of the facial and cranial bones. The common form
is that in which one or other maxilla is affected, its size progressively
increasing both regularly and irregularly, and thus encroaching
on the cavities of the orbit, the mouth, the nose and
its accessory sinuses. Exophthalmos gradually develops, going
on later to a complete loss of sight due to compression of the optic
nerve by the overgrowth of bone. There may also be interference
with the nasal respiration and with the taking of food. In the
somewhat less common form of this rare disease the overgrowth
of bone affects all the cranial bones as well as those of the face,
the senses being lost one by one and death finally resulting
from cerebral pressure. There is no treatment other than
exposing the overgrown bone, and chipping away pieces, or
excising entirely where possible.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEONTINI<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (mod. <i>Lentini</i>), an ancient town in the south-east
of Sicily, 22 m. N.N.W. of Syracuse direct, founded by Chalcidians
from Naxos in 729 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It is almost the only Greek settlement
not on the coast, from which it is 6 m. distant. The site, originally
held by the Sicels, was seized by the Greeks owing to its
command of the fertile plain on the north. It was reduced to
subjection in 498 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by Hippocrates of Gela, and in 476 Hieron
of Syracuse established here the inhabitants of Catana and
Naxos. Later on Leontini regained its independence, but in its
efforts to retain it, the intervention of Athens was more than
once invoked. It was mainly the eloquence of Gorgias (<i>q.v.</i>)
of Leontini which led to the abortive Athenian expedition of 427.
In 422 Syracuse supported the oligarchs against the people and
received them as citizens, Leontini itself being forsaken. This
led to renewed Athenian intervention, at first mainly diplomatic;
but the exiles of Leontini joined the envoys of Segesta in persuading
Athens to undertake the great expedition of 415. After
its failure, Leontini became subject to Syracuse once more
(see Strabo vi. 272). Its independence was guaranteed by
the treaty of 405 between Dionysius and the Carthaginians,
but it very soon lost it again. It was finally stormed by M.
Claudius Marcellus in 214 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In Roman times it seems to have
been of small importance. It was destroyed by the Saracens
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 848, and almost totally ruined by the earthquake of 1698.
The ancient city is described by Polybius (vii. 6) as lying in a
bottom between two hills, and facing north. On the western
side of this bottom ran a river with a row of houses on its western
bank under the hill. At each end was a gate, the northern
leading to the plain, the southern, at the upper end, to Syracuse.
There was an acropolis on each side of the valley, which lies
between precipitous hills with flat tops, over which buildings had
extended. The eastern hill<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> still has considerable remains of
a strongly fortified medieval castle, in which some writers are
inclined (though wrongly) to recognize portions of Greek masonry.

<i>Römische Mitteilungen</i> (1900), 61 seq. Excavations were made in
1899 in one of the ravines in a Sicel necropolis of the third period;
explorations in the various Greek cemeteries resulted in the
discovery of some fine bronzes, notably a fine bronze <i>lebes</i>, now
in the Berlin museum.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOPARD,<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span><a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> <span class="sc">Pard</span> or <span class="sc">Panther</span> (<i>Felis pardus</i>), the largest
spotted true cat of the Old World, with the exception of the snow-leopard,
which is, however, inferior in point of size to the largest
leopard. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Snow-Leopard</a></span>.) Leopards,
known in India as <i>cheeta</i> (<i>chita</i>), are characterized by the rosette-like
form of the black spots on the greater part of the body,
and the absence of a central spot from each rosette. Towards the
head and on the limbs the spots tend to become solid, but there
is great local variation in regard to their form and arrangement.
In the Indian leopard, the true <i>Felis pardus</i>, the spots are large
and rosette-like, and the same is the case with the long-haired
Persian leopard (<i>F. pardus tulliana</i>). On the other hand the
heavily built and thick-haired Manchurian <i>F. p. villosa</i> has more
consolidated spots. African leopards, again, to one of which
the name <i>F. p. leopardus</i> is applicable, show a decided tendency
to a breaking-up of the spots; West African animals being
much darker-coloured than those from the east side of the continent.</p>

<p>Both as regards structure and habits, the leopard may be
reckoned as one of the more typical representatives of the genus
<i>Felis</i>, belonging to that section in which the hyoid bone is loosely
connected with the skull, owing to imperfect ossification of its
anterior arch, and the pupil of the eye when contracted under
the influence of light is circular, not linear as in the smaller cats.</p>

<p>The size of leopards varies greatly, the head and body usually
measuring from 3½ to 4½ ft. in length, and the tail from 2½ to 3 ft.,
but some specimens exceed these limits, while the Somali leopard
(<i>F. p. nanopardus</i>) falls considerably short of them. The ground-colour
of the fur varies from a pale fawn to a rufous buff, graduating
in the Indian race into pure white on the under-parts and
inside of the limbs. Generally speaking, the spots on the under
parts and limbs are simple and blacker than those on the other
parts of the body. The bases of the ears behind are black, the
tips buff. The upper side of the tail is buff, spotted with broken
rings like the back, its under surface white with simple spots.
The hair of the cubs is longer than that of the adults, its ground-colour
less bright, and its spots less distinct. Perfectly black
leopards, which in certain lights show the characteristic markings
on the fur, are not uncommon, and are examples of <i>melanism</i>,
occurring as individual variations, sometimes in one cub out of a
litter of which the rest are normally coloured, and therefore not
indicating a distinct race, much less a species. These are met with
chiefly in southern Asia; melanism among African leopards
taking the form of an excessive breaking-up of the spots, which
finally show a tendency to coalesce.</p>

<p>In habits the leopard resembles the other large cat-like animals,
yielding to none in the ferocity of its disposition. It is exceedingly
quick in its movements, but seizes its prey by waiting in
ambush or stealthily approaching to within springing distance,
when it suddenly rushes upon it and tears it to ground with its
powerful claws and teeth. It preys upon almost any animal
it can overcome, such as antelopes, deer, sheep, goats, monkeys,
peafowl, and has a special liking for dogs. It not unfrequently
attacks human beings in India, chiefly children and old women,
but instances have been known of a leopard becoming a regular
&ldquo;man-eater.&rdquo; When favourable opportunities occur, it often
kills many more victims than it can devour at once, either to
gratify its propensity for killing or for the sake of their fresh
blood. It generally inhabits woody districts, and can climb trees
with facility when hunted, but usually lives on or near the ground,
among rocks, bushes and roots and low branches of large trees.</p>

<p>The geographical range of the leopard embraces practically all
Africa, and Asia from Palestine to China and Manchuria, inclusive
of Ceylon and the great Malay Islands as far as Java. Fossil
bones and teeth, indistinguishable from those of existing leopards,
have been found in cave-deposits of Pleistocene age in Spain,
France, Germany and England.</p>

<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEOPARDI, GIACOMO,<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1798-1837), Italian poet, was
born at Recanati in the March of Ancona, on the 29th of June
1798. All the circumstances of his parentage and education
conspired to foster his precocious and sensitive genius at the
expense of his physical and mental health. His family was
ancient and patrician, but so deeply embarrassed as to be only
rescued from ruin by the energy of his mother, who had taken
the control of business matters entirely into her own hands, and
whose engrossing devotion to her undertaking seems to have
almost dried up the springs of maternal tenderness. Count
Monaldo Leopardi, the father, a mere nullity in his own household,
secluded himself in his extensive library, to which his
nervous, sickly and deformed son had free access, and which
absorbed him exclusively in the absence of any intelligent
sympathy from his parents, any companionship except that of
his brothers and sister, or any recreation in the dullest of Italian
towns. The lad spent his days over grammars and dictionaries,
learning Latin with little assistance, and Greek and the principal
modern languages with none at all. Any ordinarily clever boy
would have emerged from this discipline a mere pedant and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>457</span>
bookworm. Leopardi came forth a Hellene, not merely a consummate
Greek scholar, but penetrated with the classical conception
of life, and a master of antique form and style. At
sixteen he composed a Latin treatise on the Roman rhetoricians
of the 2nd century, a commentary on Porphyry&rsquo;s life of Plotinus
and a history of astronomy; at seventeen he wrote on the popular
errors of the ancients, citing more than four hundred authors.
A little later he imposed upon the first scholars of Italy by two
odes in the manner of Anacreon. At eighteen he produced a
poem of considerable length, the <i>Appressamento alla Morte</i>,
which, after being lost for many years, was discovered and
published by Zanino Volta. It is a vision of the omnipotence of
death, modelled upon Petrarch, but more truly inspired by
Dante, and in its conception, machinery and general tone offering
a remarkable resemblance to Shelley&rsquo;s <i>Triumph of Life</i> (1822),
of which Leopardi probably never heard. This juvenile work
was succeeded (1819) by two lyrical compositions which at once
placed the author upon the height which he maintained ever
afterwards. The ode to Italy, and that on the monument to
Dante erected at Florence, gave voice to the dismay and affliction
with which Italy, aroused by the French Revolution from the
torpor of the 17th and 18th centuries, contemplated her forlorn
and degraded condition, her political impotence, her degeneracy
in arts and arms and the frivolity or stagnation of her intellectual
life. They were the outcry of a student who had found an ideal
of national existence in his books, and to whose disappointment
everything in his own circumstances lent additional poignancy.
But there is nothing unmanly or morbid in the expression of these
sentiments, and the odes are surprisingly exempt from the
failings characteristic of young poets. They are remarkably
chaste in diction, close and nervous in style, sparing in fancy and
almost destitute of simile and metaphor, antique in spirit, yet
pervaded by modern ideas, combining Landor&rsquo;s dignity with a
considerable infusion of the passion of Byron. These qualities
continued to characterize Leopardi&rsquo;s poetical writings throughout
his life. A third ode, on Cardinal Mai&rsquo;s discoveries of ancient
MSS., lamented in the same spirit of indignant sorrow the
decadence of Italian literature. The publication of these pieces
widened the breach between Leopardi and his father, a well-meaning
but apparently dull and apathetic man, who had lived into the
19th century without imbibing any of its spirit, and who provoked
his son&rsquo;s contempt by a superstition unpardonable in a scholar
of real learning. Very probably from a mistaken idea of duty to
his son, very probably, too, from his own entire dependence in
pecuniary matters upon his wife, he for a long time obstinately
refused Leopardi funds, recreation, change of scene, everything
that could have contributed to combat the growing pessimism
which eventually became nothing less than monomaniacal.
The affection of his brothers and sister afforded him some consolation,
and he found intellectual sympathy in the eminent
scholar and patriot Pietro Giordani, with whom he assiduously
corresponded at this period, partly on the ways and means of
escaping from &ldquo;this hermitage, or rather seraglio, where the
delights of civil society and the advantages of solitary life are
alike wanting.&rdquo; This forms the keynote of numerous letters of
complaint and lamentation, as touching but as effeminate in
their pathos as those of the banished Ovid. It must be remembered
in fairness that the weakness of Leopardi&rsquo;s eyesight
frequently deprived him for months together of the resource of
study. At length (1822) his father allowed him to repair to
Rome, where, though cheered by the encouragement of C. C. J.
Bunsen and Niebuhr, he found little satisfaction in the trifling
pedantry that passed for philology and archaeology, while his
sceptical opinions prevented his taking orders, the indispensable
condition of public employment in the Papal States. Dispirited
and with exhausted means, he returned to Recanati, where he
spent three miserable years, brightened only by the production
of several lyrical masterpieces, which appeared in 1824. The
most remarkable is perhaps the <i>Bruto Minore</i>, the condensation
of his philosophy of despair. In 1825 he accepted an engagement
to edit Cicero and Petrarch for the publisher Stella at Milan,
and took up his residence at Bologna, where his life was for a
time made almost cheerful by the friendship of the countess
Malvezzi. In 1827 appeared the <i>Operette Morali</i>, consisting
principally of dialogues and his imaginary biography of Filippo
Ottonieri, which have given Leopardi a fame as a prose writer
hardly inferior to his celebrity as a poet. Modern literature has
few productions so eminently classical in form and spirit, so
symmetrical in construction and faultless in style. Lucian is
evidently the model; but the wit and irony which were playthings
to Lucian are terribly earnest with Leopardi. Leopardi&rsquo;s
invention is equal to Lucian&rsquo;s and his only drawback in comparison
with his exemplar is that, while the latter&rsquo;s campaign
against pretence and imposture commands hearty sympathy,
Leopardi&rsquo;s philosophical creed is a repulsive hedonism in the
disguise of austere stoicism. The chief interlocutors in his
dialogues all profess the same unmitigated pessimism, claim
emancipation from every illusion that renders life tolerable to
the vulgar, and assert or imply a vast moral and intellectual
superiority over unenlightened mankind. When, however, we
come to inquire what renders them miserable, we find it is nothing
but the privation of pleasurable sensation, fame, fortune or
some other external thing which a lofty code of ethics would
deny to be either indefeasibly due to man or essential to his
felicity. A page of <i>Sartor Resartus</i> scatters Leopardi&rsquo;s sophistry
to the winds, and leaves nothing of his dialogues but the consummate
literary skill that would render the least fragment
precious. As works of art they are a possession for ever, as
contributions to moral philosophy they are worthless, and apart
from their literary qualities can only escape condemnation if
regarded as lyrical expressions of emotion, the wail extorted
from a diseased mind by a diseased body. <i>Filippo Ottonieri</i> is
a portrait of an imaginary philosopher, imitated from the
biography of a real sage in Lucian&rsquo;s <i>Demonax</i>. Lucian has shown
us the philosopher he wished to copy, Leopardi has truly depicted
the philosopher he was. Nothing can be more striking or more
tragical than the picture of the man superior to his fellows in
every quality of head and heart, and yet condemned to sterility
and impotence because he has, as he imagines, gone a step too
far on the road to truth, and illusions exist for him no more.
The little tract is full of remarks on life and character of surprising
depth and justice, manifesting what powers of observation as well
as reflection were possessed by the sickly youth who had seen so
little of the world.</p>

<p>Want of means soon drove Leopardi back to Recanati, where,
deaf, half-blind, sleepless, tortured by incessant pain, at war
with himself and every one around him except his sister, he
spent the two most unhappy years of his unhappy life. In May
1831 he escaped to Florence, where he formed the acquaintance
of a young Swiss philologist, M. de Sinner. To him he confided
his unpublished philological writings, with a view to their
appearance in Germany. A selection appeared under the title
<i>Excerpta ex schedis criticis J. Leopardi</i> (Bonn, 1834). The
remaining MSS. were purchased after Sinner&rsquo;s death by the
Italian government, and, together with Leopardi&rsquo;s correspondence
with the Swiss philologist, were partially edited by Aulard.
In 1831 appeared a new edition of Leopardi&rsquo;s poems, comprising
several new pieces of the highest merit. These are in general
less austerely classical than his earlier compositions, and evince
a greater tendency to description, and a keener interest in the
works and ways of ordinary mankind. <i>The Resurrection</i>, composed
on occasion of his unexpected recovery, is a model of
concentrated energy of diction, and <i>The Song of the Wandering
Shepherd in Asia</i> is one of the highest flights of modern lyric
poetry. The range of the author&rsquo;s ideas is still restricted, but
his style and melody are unsurpassable. Shortly after the
publication of these pieces (October 1831) Leopardi was driven
from Florence to Rome by an unhappy attachment. His feelings
are powerfully expressed in two poems, <i>To Himself</i> and <i>Aspasia</i>,
which seem to breathe wounded pride at least as much as wounded
love. In 1832 Leopardi returned to Florence, and there formed
acquaintance with a young Neapolitan, Antonio Ranieri, himself
an author of merit, and destined to enact towards him the part
performed by Severn towards Keats, an enviable title to renown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
if Ranieri had not in his old age tarnished it by assuming the
relation of Trelawny to the dead Byron. Leopardi accompanied
Ranieri and his sister to Naples, and under their care enjoyed
four years of comparative tranquillity. He made the acquaintance
of the German poet Platen, his sole modern rival in the
classical perfection of form, and composed <i>La Ginestra</i>, the most
consummate of all his lyrical masterpieces, strongly resembling
Shelley&rsquo;s <i>Mont Blanc</i>, but more perfect in expression. He also
wrote at Naples <i>The Sequel to the Battle of the Frogs and Mice</i>,
a satire in <i>ottava rima</i> on the abortive Neapolitan revolution of
1820, clever and humorous, but obscure from the local character
of the allusions. The more painful details of his Neapolitan
residence may be found by those who care to seek for them in
the deplorable publication of Ranieri&rsquo;s peevish old age (<i>Sette
anni di sodalizio</i>). The decay of Leopardi&rsquo;s constitution continued;
he became dropsical; and a sudden crisis of his malady,
unanticipated by himself alone, put an end to his life-long
sufferings on the 15th of June 1837.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The poems which constitute Leopardi&rsquo;s principal title to immortality
are only forty-one in number, and some of these are merely
fragmentary. They may for the most part be described as odes,
meditative soliloquies, or impassioned addresses, generally couched
in a lyrical form, although a few are in magnificent blank verse.
Some idea of the style and spirit of the former might be obtained
by imagining the thoughts of the last book of Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie
Queene</i> in the metre of his <i>Epithalamium</i>. They were first edited
complete by Ranieri at Florence in 1845, forming, along with the
<i>Operette Morali</i>, the first volume of an edition of Leopardi&rsquo;s works,
which does not, however, include <i>The Sequel to the Battle of the Frogs
and Mice</i>, first printed at Paris in 1842, nor the afterwards discovered
writings. Vols. ii.-iv. contain the philological essays and translations,
with some letters, and vols. v. and vi. the remainder of the correspondence.
Later editions are those of G. Chiarini and G. Mestica.
The juvenile essays preserved in his father&rsquo;s library at Recanati
were edited by Cugnoni (<i>Opere inedite</i>) in 1879, with the consent
of the family. See Cappelleti, <i>Bibliografia Leopardiana</i> (Parma,
1882). Leopardi&rsquo;s biography is mainly in his letters (<i>Epistolario</i>,
1st ed., 1849, 5th ed., 1892), to which his later biographers (Brandes,
Bouché-Leclercq, Rosa) have merely added criticisms, excellent in
their way, more particularly Brandes&rsquo;s, but generally over-rating
Leopardi&rsquo;s significance in the history of human thought. W. E.
Gladstone&rsquo;s essay (<i>Quart. Rev.</i>, 1850), reprinted in vol. ii. of the
author&rsquo;s <i>Gleanings</i>, is too much pervaded by the theological spirit,
but is in the main a pattern of generous and discriminating eulogy.
There are excellent German translations of the poems by Heyse and
Brandes. An English translation of the essays and dialogues by
C. Edwards appeared in 1882, and most of the dialogues were translated
with extraordinary felicity by James Thomson, author of
<i>The City of Dreadful Night</i>, and originally published in the <i>National
Reformer</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOPOLD I.<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1640-1705), Roman emperor, the second son of
the emperor Ferdinand III. and his first wife Maria Anna,
daughter of Philip III. of Spain, was born on the 9th of June
1640. Intended for the Church, he received a good education,
but his prospects were changed by the death of his elder brother,
the German king Ferdinand IV., in July 1654, when he became
his father&rsquo;s heir. In 1655 he was chosen king of Hungary and
in 1656 king of Bohemia, and in July 1658, more than a year
after his father&rsquo;s death, he was elected emperor at Frankfort,
in spite of the intrigues of Cardinal Mazarin, who wished to place
on the imperial throne Ferdinand, elector of Bavaria, or some
other prince whose elevation would break the Habsburg succession.
Mazarin, however, obtained a promise from the new
emperor that he would not send assistance to Spain, then at
war with France, and, by joining a confederation of German
princes, called the league of the Rhine, France secured a certain
influence in the internal affairs of Germany. Leopold&rsquo;s long
reign covers one of the most important periods of European
history; for nearly the whole of its forty-seven years he was
pitted against Louis XIV. of France, whose dominant personality
completely overshadowed Leopold. The emperor was a man of
peace and never led his troops in person; yet the greater part
of his public life was spent in arranging and directing wars.
The first was with Sweden, whose king Charles X. found a useful
ally in the prince of Transylvania, George II. Rakocky, a rebellious
vassal of the Hungarian crown. This war, a legacy of
the last reign, was waged by Leopold as the ally of Poland until
peace was made at Oliva in 1660. A more dangerous foe next
entered the lists. The Turks interfered in the affairs of Transylvania,
always an unruly district, and this interference brought
on a war with the Empire, which after some desultory operations
really began in 1663. By a personal appeal to the diet at Regensburg
Leopold induced the princes to send assistance for the
campaign; troops were also sent by France, and in August 1664
the great imperialist general, Montecucculi, gained a notable
victory at St Gotthard. By the peace of Vasvar the emperor
made a twenty years&rsquo; truce with the sultan, granting more
generous terms than his recent victory seemed to render
necessary.</p>

<p>After a few years of peace began the first of three wars between
France and the Empire. The aggressive policy pursued by
Louis XIV. towards Holland had aroused the serious attention
of Europe, and steps had been taken to check it. Although
the French king had sought the alliance of several German
princes and encouraged the Turks in their attacks on Austria
the emperor at first took no part in this movement. He was
on friendly terms with Louis, to whom he was closely related
and with whom he had already discussed the partition of the
lands of the Spanish monarchy; moreover, in 1671 he arranged
with him a treaty of neutrality. In 1672, however, he was
forced to take action. He entered into an alliance for the
defence of Holland and war broke out; then, after this league
had collapsed owing to the defection of the elector of Brandenburg,
another and more durable alliance was formed for the same
purpose, including, besides the emperor, the king of Spain and
several German princes, and the war was renewed. At this
time, twenty-five years after the peace of Westphalia, the Empire
was virtually a confederation of independent princes, and it
was very difficult for its head to conduct any war with vigour
and success, some of its members being in alliance with the
enemy and others being only lukewarm in their support of the
imperial interests. Thus this struggle, which lasted until the
end of 1678, was on the whole unfavourable to Germany, and
the advantages of the treaty of Nijmwegen (February 1679)
were with France.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the conclusion of peace Louis
renewed his aggressions on the German frontier. Engaged in
a serious struggle with Turkey, the emperor was again slow to
move, and although he joined a league against France in 1682
he was glad to make a truce at Regensburg two years later.
In 1686 the league of Augsburg was formed by the emperor
and the imperial princes, to preserve the terms of the treaties
of Westphalia and of Nijmwegen. The whole European position
was now bound up with events in England, and the tension
lasted until 1688, when William of Orange won the English
crown and Louis invaded Germany. In May 1689 the grand
alliance was formed, including the emperor, the kings of England,
Spain and Denmark, the elector of Brandenburg and others,
and a fierce struggle against France was waged throughout
almost the whole of western Europe. In general the several
campaigns were favourable to the allies, and in September
1697 England and Holland made peace with Louis at Ryswick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>459</span>
To this treaty Leopold refused to assent, as he considered that
his allies had somewhat neglected his interests, but in the following
month he came to terms and a number of places were transferred
from France to Germany. The peace with France lasted
for about four years and then Europe was involved in the War
of the Spanish Succession. The king of Spain, Charles II., was
a Habsburg by descent and was related by marriage to the
Austrian branch, while a similar tie bound him to the royal
house of France. He was feeble and childless, and attempts had
been made by the European powers to arrange for a peaceable
division of his extensive kingdom. Leopold refused to consent
to any partition, and when in November 1700 Charles died,
leaving his crown to Philip, duke of Anjou, a grandson of
Louis XIV., all hopes of a peaceable settlement vanished. Under
the guidance of William III. a powerful league, the grand alliance,
was formed against France; of this the emperor was a prominent
member, and in 1703 he transferred his claim on the Spanish
monarchy to his second son, the archduke Charles. The early
course of the war was not favourable to the imperialists, but the
tide of defeat had been rolled back by the great victory of
Blenheim before Leopold died on the 5th of May 1705.</p>

<p>In governing his own lands Leopold found his chief difficulties
in Hungary, where unrest was caused partly by his desire to
crush Protestantism. A rising was suppressed in 1671 and for
some years Hungary was treated with great severity. In 1681,
after another rising, some grievances were removed and a less
repressive policy was adopted, but this did not deter the Hungarians
from revolting again. Espousing the cause of the rebels
the sultan sent an enormous army into Austria early in 1683;
this advanced almost unchecked to Vienna, which was besieged
from July to September, while Leopold took refuge at Passau.
Realizing the gravity of the situation somewhat tardily, some
of the German princes, among them the electors of Saxony and
Bavaria, led their contingents to the imperial army which was
commanded by the emperor&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Charles, duke of
Lorraine, but the most redoubtable of Leopold&rsquo;s allies was
the king of Poland, John Sobieski, who was already dreaded by
the Turks. On the 12th of September 1683 the allied army
fell upon the enemy, who was completely routed, and Vienna
was saved. The imperialists, among whom Prince Eugene of
Savoy was rapidly becoming prominent, followed up the victory
with others, notably one near Mohacz in 1687 and another at
Zenta in 1697, and in January 1699 the sultan signed the treaty
of Karlowitz by which he admitted the sovereign rights of the
house of Habsburg over nearly the whole of Hungary. Before
the conclusion of the war, however, Leopold had taken measures
to strengthen his hold upon this country. In 1687 at the diet
of Pressburg the constitution was changed, the right of the
Habsburgs to succeed to the throne without election was
admitted and the emperor&rsquo;s elder son Joseph was crowned
hereditary king of Hungary.</p>

<p>During this reign some important changes were made in the
constitution of the Empire. In 1663 the imperial diet entered
upon the last stage of its existence, and became a body permanently
in session at Regensburg; in 1692 the duke of Hanover
was raised to the rank of an elector, becoming the ninth member
of the electoral college; and in 1700 Leopold, greatly in need
of help for the impending war with France, granted the title
of king of Prussia to the elector of Brandenburg. The net
result of these and similar changes was to weaken the authority
of the emperor over the members of the Empire, and to compel
him to rely more and more upon his position as ruler of the
Austrian archduchies and of Hungary and Bohemia, and Leopold
was the first who really appears to have realized this altered
state of affairs and to have acted in accordance therewith.</p>

<p>The emperor was married three times. His first wife was
Margaret Theresa (d. 1673), daughter of Philip IV. of Spain;
his second Claudia Felicitas (d. 1676), the heiress of Tirol;
and his third Eleanora, a princess of the Palatinate. By his
first two wives he had no sons, but his third wife bore him two,
Joseph and Charles, both of whom became emperors. He had
also four daughters.</p>

<p>Leopold was a man of industry and education, and during his
later years he showed some political ability. Extremely tenacious
of his rights, and regarding himself as an absolute sovereign,
he was also very intolerant and was greatly influenced by the
Jesuits. In person he was short, but strong and healthy.
Although he had no inclination for a military life he loved
exercises in the open air, such as hunting and riding; he had
also a taste for music.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOPOLD II.<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (1747-1792), Roman emperor, and grand-duke
of Tuscany, son of the empress Maria Theresa and her husband,
Francis I., was born in Vienna on the 5th of May 1747. He was
a third son, and was at first educated for the priesthood, but the
theological studies to which he was forced to apply himself
are believed to have influenced his mind in a way unfavourable
to the Church. On the death of his elder brother Charles in
1761 it was decided that he should succeed to his father&rsquo;s grand
duchy of Tuscany, which was erected into a &ldquo;secundogeniture&rdquo;
or apanage for a second son. This settlement was the condition
of his marriage on the 5th of August 1764 with Maria Louisa,
daughter of Charles III. of Spain, and on the death of his father
Francis I. (13th August 1765) he succeeded to the grand duchy.
For five years he exercised little more than nominal authority
under the supervision of counsellors appointed by his mother.
In 1770 he made a journey to Vienna to secure the removal of
this vexatious guardianship, and returned to Florence with a
free hand. During the twenty years which elapsed between
his return to Florence and the death of his eldest brother
Joseph II. in 1790 he was employed in reforming the administration
of his small state. The reformation was carried out by the
removal of the ruinous restrictions on industry and personal
freedom imposed by his predecessors of the house of Medici, and
left untouched during his father&rsquo;s life; by the introduction of a
rational system of taxation; and by the execution of profitable
public works, such as the drainage of the Val di Chiana. As
he had no army to maintain, and as he suppressed the small
naval force kept up by the Medici, the whole of his revenue
was left free for the improvement of his state. Leopold was
never popular with his Italian subjects. His disposition was cold
and retiring. His habits were simple to the verge of sordidness,
though he could display splendour on occasion, and he could
not help offending those of his subjects who had profited by the
abuses of the Medicean régime. But his steady, consistent and
intelligent administration, which advanced step by step, making
the second only when the first had been justified by results,
brought the grand duchy to a high level of material prosperity.
His ecclesiastical policy, which disturbed the deeply rooted
convictions of his people, and brought him into collision with
the pope, was not successful. He was unable to secularize the
property of the religious houses, or to put the clergy entirely
under the control of the lay power.</p>

<p>During the last few years of his rule in Tuscany Leopold had
begun to be frightened by the increasing disorders in the German
and Hungarian dominions of his family, which were the direct
result of his brother&rsquo;s headlong methods. He and Joseph II.
were tenderly attached to one another, and met frequently both
before and after the death of their mother, while the portrait
by Pompeo Baltoni in which they appear together shows that
they bore a strong personal resemblance to one another. But
it may be said of Leopold, as of Fontenelle, that his heart was
made of brains. He knew that he must succeed his childless
eldest brother in Austria, and he was unwilling to inherit his
unpopularity. When, therefore, in 1789 Joseph, who knew
himself to be dying, asked him to come to Vienna, and become
co-regent, Leopold coldly evaded the request. He was still
in Florence when Joseph II. died at Vienna on the 20th of
February 1790, and he did not leave his Italian capital till the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
3rd of March. Leopold, during his government in Tuscany,
had shown a speculative tendency to grant his subjects a constitution.
When he succeeded to the Austrian lands he began
by making large concessions to the interests offended by his
brother&rsquo;s innovations. He recognized the Estates of his different
dominions as &ldquo;the pillars of the monarchy,&rdquo; pacified the
Hungarians and divided the Belgian insurgents by concessions.
When these failed to restore order, he marched troops into the
country, and re-established at the same time his own authority,
and the historic franchises of the Flemings. Yet he did not
surrender any part that could be retained of what Maria Theresa
and Joseph had done to strengthen the hands of the state. He
continued, for instance, to insist that no papal bull could be
published in his dominions without his consent (<i>placetum regium</i>).</p>

<p>If Leopold&rsquo;s reign as emperor, and king of Hungary and
Bohemia, had been prolonged during years of peace, it is probable
that he would have repeated his successes as a reforming ruler
in Tuscany on a far larger scale. But he lived for barely two
years, and during that period he was hard pressed by peril from
west and east alike. The growing revolutionary disorders in
France endangered the life of his sister Marie Antoinette, the
queen of Louis XVI., and also threatened his own dominions
with the spread of a subversive agitation. His sister sent him
passionate appeals for help, and he was pestered by the royalist
emigrants, who were intriguing both to bring about an armed
intervention in France, and against Louis XVI. From the east
he was threatened by the aggressive ambition of Catherine II.
of Russia, and by the unscrupulous policy of Prussia. Catherine
would have been delighted to see Austria and Prussia embark
on a crusade in the cause of kings against the Revolution. While
they were busy beyond the Rhine, she would have annexed what
remained of Poland, and would have made conquests in Turkey.
Leopold II. had no difficulty in seeing through the rather transparent
cunning of the Russian empress, and he refused to be
misled. To his sister he gave good advice and promises of help
if she and her husband could escape from Paris. The emigrants
who followed him pertinaciously were refused audience, or when
they forced themselves on him were peremptorily denied all
help. Leopold was too purely a politician not to be secretly
pleased at the destruction of the power of France and of her
influence in Europe by her internal disorders. Within six
weeks of his accession he displayed his contempt for her weakness
by practically tearing up the treaty of alliance made by Maria
Theresa in 1756 and opening negotiations with England to impose
a check on Russia and Prussia. He was able to put pressure
on England by threatening to cede his part of the Low Countries
to France, and then, when secure of English support, he was in a
position to baffle the intrigues of Prussia. A personal appeal to
Frederick William II. led to a conference between them at
Reichenbach in July 1790, and to an arrangement which was in fact
a defeat for Prussia. Leopold&rsquo;s coronation as king of Hungary on
the 15th of November 1790, was preceded by a settlement with the
diet in which he recognized the dominant position of the Magyars.
He had already made an eight months&rsquo; truce with the Turks
in September, which prepared the way for the termination of
the war begun by Joseph II., the peace of Sistova being signed
in August 1791. The pacification of his eastern dominions
left Leopold free to re-establish order in Belgium and to confirm
friendly relations with England and Holland.</p>

<p>During 1791 the emperor continued to be increasingly preoccupied
with the affairs of France. In January he had to
dismiss the count of Artois, afterwards Charles X., king of France,
in a very peremptory way. His good sense was revolted by the
folly of the French emigrants, and he did his utmost to avoid
being entangled in the affairs of that country. The insults
inflicted on Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette, however, at the
time of their attempted flight to Varennes in June, stirred his
indignation, and he made a general appeal to the sovereigns
of Europe to take common measures in view of events which
&ldquo;immediately compromised the honour of all sovereigns, and
the security of all governments.&rdquo; Yet he was most directly
interested in the conference at Sistova, which in June led to a
final peace with Turkey. On the 25th of August he met the
king of Prussia at Pillnitz, near Dresden, and they drew up a
declaration of their readiness to intervene in France if and when
their assistance was called for by the other powers. The declaration
was a mere formality, for, as Leopold knew, neither Russia
nor England was prepared to act, and he endeavoured to guard
against the use which he foresaw the emigrants would endeavour
to make of it. In face of the agitation caused by the Pillnitz
declaration in France, the intrigues of the emigrants, and the
attacks made by the French revolutionists on the rights of the
German princes in Alsace, Leopold continued to hope that
intervention might not be required. When Louis XVI. swore
to observe the constitution of September 1791, the emperor
professed to think that a settlement had been reached in France.
The attacks on the rights of the German princes on the left
bank of the Rhine, and the increasing violence of the parties
in Paris which were agitating to bring about war, soon showed,
however, that this hope was vain. Leopold met the threatening
language of the revolutionists with dignity and temper. His
sudden death on the 1st of March 1792 was an irreparable loss
to Austria.</p>

<p>Leopold had sixteen children, the eldest of his eight sons
being his successor, the emperor Francis II. Some of his other
sons were prominent personages in their day. Among them were:
Ferdinand III., grand duke of Tuscany; the archduke Charles,
a celebrated soldier; the archduke John, also a soldier; the
archduke Joseph, palatine of Hungary; and the archduke
Rainer, viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOPOLD I.<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1790-1865), king of the Belgians, fourth son
of Francis, duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and uncle of Queen
Victoria of England, was born at Coburg on the 18th of December
1790. At the age of eighteen he entered the military service
of Russia, and accompanied the emperor Alexander to Erfurt
as a member of his staff. He was required by Napoleon to quit
the Russian army, and spent some years in travelling. In 1813
he accepted from the emperor Alexander the post of a cavalry
general in the army of invasion, and he took part in the whole
of the campaign of that and the following year, distinguishing
himself in the battles of Leipzig, Lützen and Bautzen. He
entered Paris with the allied sovereigns, and accompanied them
to England. He married in May 1816 Charlotte, only child
of George, prince regent, afterwards George IV., heiress-presumptive
to the British throne, and was created duke of Kendal
in the British peerage and given an annuity of £50,000. The
death of the princess in the following year was a heavy blow
to his hopes, but he continued to reside in England. In 1830
he declined the offer of the crown of Greece, owing to the refusal
of the powers to grant conditions which he considered essential
to the welfare of the new kingdom, but was in the following year
elected king of the Belgians (4th June 1831). After some
hesitation he accepted the crown, having previously ascertained
that he would have the support of the great powers on entering
upon his difficult task, and on the 12th of July he made his
entry into Brussels and took the oath to observe the constitution.
During the first eight years of his reign he was confronted with
the resolute hostility of King William I. of Holland, and it was
not until 1839 that the differences between the two states,
which until 1830 had formed the kingdom of the Netherlands,
were finally settled at the conference of London by the treaty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>
of the 24 Articles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Belgium</a></span>). From this date until his
death, King Leopold spent all his energies in the wise administration
of the affairs of the newly formed kingdom, which may be
said to owe in a large measure its first consolidation and constant
prosperity to the care and skill of his discreet and fatherly
government. In 1848 the throne of Belgium stood unshaken
amidst the revolutions which marked that year in almost every
European country. On the 8th of August 1832 Leopold married,
as his second wife, Louise of Orleans, daughter of Louis Philippe,
king of the French. Queen Louise endeared herself to the
Belgian people, and her death in 1850 was felt as a national loss.
This union produced two sons and one daughter&mdash;(1) Leopold,
afterwards king of the Belgians; (2) Philip, count of Flanders;
(3) Marie Charlotte, who married Maximilian of Austria, the
unfortunate emperor of Mexico. Leopold I. died at Laeken
on the 10th of December 1865. He was a most cultured man and
a great reader, and did his utmost during his reign to encourage
art, science and education. His judgment was universally
respected by contemporary sovereigns and statesmen, and he
was frequently spoken of as &ldquo;the Nestor of Europe&rdquo; (see also
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Victoria, Queen</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOPOLD II.<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor</span>]
(1835-1909), king of the Belgians, son of the preceding, was born
at Brussels on the 9th of April 1835. In 1846 he was created
duke of Brabant and appointed a sub-lieutenant in the army,
in which he served until his accession, by which time he had
reached the rank of lieutenant-general. On attaining his
majority he was made a member of the senate, in whose proceedings
he took a lively interest, especially in matters concerning
the development of Belgium and its trade. On the 22nd of
August 1853 Leopold married Marie Henriette (1836-1902),
daughter of the archduke Joseph of Austria, palatine of Hungary,
by his wife Marie Dorothea, duchess of Württemberg. This
princess, who was a great-granddaughter of the empress Maria
Theresa, and a great-niece of Marie Antoinette, endeared herself
to the people by her elevated character and indefatigable
benevolence, while her beauty gained for her the sobriquet of
&ldquo;The Rose of Brabant&rdquo;; she was also an accomplished artist
and musician, and a fine horsewoman. Between the years
1854 and 1865 Leopold travelled much abroad, visiting India
and China as well as Egypt and the countries on the Mediterranean
coast of Africa. On the 10th of December 1865 he
succeeded his father. On the 28th of January 1869 he lost his
only son, Leopold (b. 1859), duke of Hainaut. The king&rsquo;s
brother Philip, count of Flanders (1837-1905), then became
heir to the throne; and on his death his son Albert (b. 1875)
became heir-presumptive. During the Franco-Prussian War
(1870-1871) the king of the Belgians preserved neutrality in
a period of unusual difficulty and danger. But the most notable
event in Leopold&rsquo;s career was the foundation of the Congo Free
State (<i>q.v.</i>). While still duke of Brabant he had been the first
to call the attention of the Belgians to the need of enlarging
their horizon beyond sea, and after his accession to the throne
he gave the first impulse towards the development of this idea
by founding in 1876 the <i>Association Internationale Africaine</i>.
He enlisted the services of H. M. Stanley, who visited Brussels
in 1878 after exploring the Congo river, and returned in 1879
to the Congo as agent of the <i>Comité d&rsquo;Études du Haut Congo</i>,
soon afterwards reorganized as the &ldquo;International Association
of the Congo.&rdquo; This association was, in 1884-1885, recognized
by the powers as a sovereign state under the name of the <i>État
Indépendant du Congo</i>. Leopold&rsquo;s exploitation of this vast
territory, which he administered autocratically, and in which
he associated himself personally with various financial schemes,
was understood to bring him an enormous fortune; it was
the subject of acutely hostile criticism, to a large extent substantiated
by the report of a commission of inquiry instituted
by the king himself in 1904, and followed in 1908 by the annexation
of the state to Belgium (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Congo Free State</a></span>: <i>History</i>).
In 1880 Leopold sought an interview with General C. G. Gordon
and obtained his promise, subject to the approval of the British
government, to enter the Belgian service on the Congo. Three
years later Leopold claimed fulfilment of the promise, and
Gordon was about to proceed to the Congo when the British
government required his services for the Sudan. On the 15th
of November 1902 King Leopold&rsquo;s life was attempted in Brussels
by an Italian anarchist named Rubino. Queen Marie Henriette
died at Spa on the 19th of September of the same year. Besides
the son already mentioned she had borne to Leopold three
daughters&mdash;Louise Marie Amélie (b. 1858), who in 1875 married
Philip of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and was divorced in 1906;
Stéphanie (b. 1864), who married Rudolph, crown prince of
Austria, in 1881, and after his death in 1889 married, against
her father&rsquo;s wishes, Elemer, Count Lonyay, in 1900; and
Clémentine (b. 1872). At the time of the queen&rsquo;s death an
unseemly incident was occasioned by Leopold&rsquo;s refusal to see
his daughter Stéphanie, who in consequence was not present at
her mother&rsquo;s funeral. The disagreeable impression on the public
mind thus created was deepened by an unfortunate litigation,
lasting for two years (1904-1906), over the deceased queen&rsquo;s
will, in which the creditors of the princess Louise, together
with princess Stéphanie (Countess Lonyay), claimed that under
the Belgian law the queen&rsquo;s estate was entitled to half of her
husband&rsquo;s property. This claim was disallowed by the Belgian
courts. The king died at Laeken, near Brussels, on the 17th
of December 1909. On the 23rd of that month his nephew
took the oath to observe the constitution, assuming the title of
Albert I. King Leopold was personally a man of considerable
attainments and much strength of character, but he was a
notoriously dissolute monarch, who even to the last offended
decent opinion by his indulgences at Paris and on the Riviera.
The wealth he amassed from the Congo he spent, no doubt,
royally not only in this way but also on public improvements
in Belgium; but he had a hard heart towards the natives of
his distant possession.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOPOLD II.<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1797-1870), of Habsburg-Lorraine, grand-duke
of Tuscany, was born on the 3rd of October 1797, the son of the
grand-duke Ferdinand III., whom he succeeded in 1824. During
the first twenty years of his reign he devoted himself to the
internal development of the state. His was the mildest and least
reactionary of all the Italian despotisms of the day, and although
always subject to Austrian influence he refused to adopt the
Austrian methods of government, allowed a fair measure of
liberty to the press, and permitted many political exiles from
other states to dwell in Tuscany undisturbed. But when in the
early &rsquo;forties a feeling of unrest spread throughout Italy, even in
Tuscany demands for a constitution and other political reforms
were advanced; in 1845-1846 riots broke out in various parts of
the country, and Leopold granted a number of administrative
reforms. But Austrian influence prevented him from going
further, even had he wished to do so. The election of Pope Pius
IX. gave fresh impulse to the Liberal movement, and on the
4th of September 1847 Leopold instituted the National Guard&mdash;a
first step towards the constitution; shortly after the marchese
Cosimo Ridolfi was appointed prime minister. The granting of
the Neapolitan and Piedmontese constitutions was followed
(17th February 1848) by that of Tuscany, drawn up by Gino
Capponi. The revolution in Milan and Vienna aroused a fever
of patriotic enthusiasm in Tuscany, where war against Austria
was demanded; Leopold, giving way to popular pressure, sent
a force of regulars and volunteers to co-operate with Piedmont
in the Lombard campaign. His speech on their departure was
uncompromisingly Italian and Liberal. &ldquo;Soldiers,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the holy cause of Italian freedom is being decided to-day on the
fields of Lombardy. Already the citizens of Milan have purchased
their liberty with their blood and with a heroism of which history
offers few examples.... Honour to the arms of Italy! Long
live Italian independence!&rdquo; The Tuscan contingent fought
bravely, if unsuccessfully, at Curtatone and Montanara. On the
26th of June the first Tuscan parliament assembled, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>
disturbances consequent on the failure of the campaign in
Lombardy led to the resignation of the Ridolfi ministry, which
was succeeded by that of Gino Capponi. The riots continued,
especially at Leghorn, which was a prey to actual civil war, and
the democratic party of which F. D. Guerrazzi and G. Montanelli
were leading lights became every day more influential. Capponi
resigned, and Leopold reluctantly agreed to a Montanelli-Guerrazzi
ministry, which in its turn had to fight against the
extreme republican party. New elections in the autumn of
1848 returned a constitutional majority, but it ended by voting
in favour of a constituent assembly. There was talk of instituting
a central Italian kingdom with Leopold as king, to form part of
a larger Italian federation, but in the meanwhile the grand-duke,
alarmed at the revolutionary and republican agitations in
Tuscany and encouraged by the success of the Austrian arms,
was, according to Montanelli, negotiating with Field-Marshal
Radetzky and with Pius IX., who had now abandoned his
Liberal tendencies, and fled to Gaeta. Leopold had left Florence
for Siena, and eventually for Porto S. Stefano, leaving a letter
to Guerrazzi in which, on account of a protest from the pope,
he declared that he could not agree to the proposed constituent
assembly. The utmost confusion prevailed in Florence and other
parts of Tuscany. On the 9th of February 1849 the republic
was proclaimed, largely as a result of Mazzini&rsquo;s exhortations,
and on the 18th Leopold sailed for Gaeta. A third parliament
was elected and Guerrazzi appointed dictator. But there was
great discontent, and the defeat of Charles Albert at Novara
caused consternation among the Liberals. The majority, while
fearing an Austrian invasion, desired the return of the grand-duke
who had never been unpopular, and in April 1849 the municipal
council usurped the powers of the assembly and invited him to
return, &ldquo;to save us by means of the restoration of the constitutional
monarchy surrounded by popular institutions, from the
shame and ruin of a foreign invasion.&rdquo; Leopold accepted,
although he said nothing about the foreign invasion, and on the
1st of May sent Count Luigi Serristori to Tuscany with full
powers. But at the same time the Austrians occupied Lucca
and Leghorn, and although Leopold simulated surprise at their
action it has since been proved, as the Austrian general d&rsquo;Aspre
declared at the time, that Austrian intervention was due to the
request of the grand-duke. On the 24th of May the latter
appointed G. Baldasseroni prime minister, on the 25th the
Austrians entered Florence and on the 28th of July Leopold
himself returned. In April 1850 he concluded a treaty with
Austria sanctioning the continuation for an indefinite period of
the Austrian occupation with 10,000 men; in September he
dismissed parliament, and the following year established a
concordat with the Church of a very clerical character. He
feebly asked Austria if he might maintain the constitution, and
the Austrian premier, Prince Schwarzenberg, advised him to
consult the pope, the king of Naples and the dukes of Parma and
Modena. On their advice he formally revoked the constitution
(1852). Political trials were held, Guerrazzi and many others
being condemned to long terms of imprisonment, and although
in 1855 the Austrian troops left Tuscany, Leopold&rsquo;s popularity
was gone. A part of the Liberals, however, still believed in the
possibility of a constitutional grand-duke who could be induced
for a second time to join Piedmont in a war against Austria,
whereas the popular party headed by F. Bartolommei and
G. Dolfi realized that only by the expulsion of Leopold could the
national aspirations be realized. When in 1859 France and
Piedmont made war on Austria, Leopold&rsquo;s government failed to
prevent numbers of young Tuscan volunteers from joining the
Franco-Piedmontese forces. Finally an agreement was arrived
at between the aristocratic constitutionalists and the popular
party, as a result of which the grand-duke&rsquo;s participation in the
war was formally demanded. Leopold at first gave way, and
entrusted Don Neri Corsini with the formation of a ministry.
The popular demands presented by Corsini were for the abdication
of Leopold in favour of his son, an alliance with Piedmont
and the reorganization of Tuscany in accordance with the
eventual and definite reorganization of Italy. Leopold hesitated
and finally rejected the proposals as derogatory to his dignity.
On the 27th of April there was great excitement in Florence,
Italian colours appeared everywhere, but order was maintained,
and the grand-duke and his family departed for Bologna undisturbed.
Thus the revolution was accomplished without a
drop of blood being shed, and after a period of provisional government
Tuscany was incorporated in the kingdom of Italy. On the
21st of July Leopold abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand IV.,
who never reigned, but issued a protest from Dresden (26th
March 1860). He spent his last years in Austria, and died in
Rome on the 29th of January 1870.</p>

<p>Leopold of Tuscany was a well-meaning, not unkindly man,
and fonder of his subjects than were the other Italian despots,
but he was weak, and too closely bound by family ties and
Habsburg traditions ever to become a real Liberal. Had he not
joined the conclave of autocrats at Gaeta, and, above all, had he
not summoned Austrian assistance while denying that he had
done so, in 1849, he might yet have preserved his throne, and
even changed the whole course of Italian history. At the same
time his rule, if not harsh, was enervating and demoralizing.</p>

a length N. to S. of about 75 m., is 30 m. across at its northern

lake is fed by the Lokoro (about 300 m. long) and smaller streams
from the east. Its northern and western affluents are comparatively
unimportant. It discharges its waters (at its southern

was descended from Theopompus through his younger son
Anaxandridas (Herod. viii. 131), and in 491 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> succeeded
Demaratus (<i>q.v.</i>), whose title to the throne he had with Cleomenes&rsquo;
aid successfully challenged. He took part in Cleomenes&rsquo; second
expedition to Aegina, on which ten hostages were seized and
handed over to the Athenians for safe custody: for this he
narrowly escaped being surrendered to the Aeginetans after
Cleomenes&rsquo; death. In the spring of 479 we find him in command
of the Greek fleet of 110 ships, first at Aegina and afterwards
at Delos. In August he attacked the Persian position at Mycale
on the coast of Asia Minor opposite Samos, inflicted a crushing
defeat on the land-army, and annihilated the fleet which was
drawn up on the shore. Soon afterwards he sailed home with
the Peloponnesians, leaving the Athenians to prosecute the siege
of Sestos. In 476 he led an army to Thessaly to punish the
Aleuadae of Larisa for the aid they had rendered to the Persians
and to strengthen Spartan influence in northern Greece. After
a series of successful engagements he accepted a bribe from the
enemy to withdraw. For this he was brought to trial at Sparta,
and to save his life fled to the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea.
Sentence of exile was passed, his house was razed and his grandson
Archidamus II. ascended the throne (Herod. vi. 65-87,
ix. 90-114; Thucydides i. 89; Pausanias iii. 4. 3. 7. 9-10;
Plutarch, <i>De malignitate Herodoti</i>, 21, p. 859 <span class="scs">D</span>; Diodorus xi.

<div class="condensed">
<p>According to Diodorus (xi. 48) Leotychides reigned twenty-two,
his successor Archidamus forty-two years. The total duration of
the two reigns, sixty-four years, we know to be correct, for Leotychides
came to the throne in 491 and Archidamus (<i>q.v.</i>) died in 427.
On this basis, then, Leotychides&rsquo;s exile would fall in 469 and the
Thessalian expedition in that or the preceding year (so E. Meyer,
<i>Geschichte des Altertums</i>, iii. § 287). But Diodorus is not consistent
with himself; he attributes (xi. 48) Leotychides&rsquo;s death to the year
476-475 and he records (xii. 35) Archidamus&rsquo;s death in 434-433,
though he introduces him in the following years at the head of the
Peloponnesian army (xii. 42, 47, 52). Further, he says expressly
that Leotychides <span class="grk" title="eteleutêsen arxas etê eikosi kai duo">&#7952;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7940;&#961;&#958;&#945;&#962; &#7956;&#964;&#951; &#949;&#7988;&#954;&#959;&#963;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#973;&#959;</span>, <i>i.e.</i> he lived
twenty-two years after his accession. The twenty-two years, then,
may include the time which elapsed between his exile and his death.
In that case Leotychides died in 469, and 476-475 may be the year
in which his reign, though not his life, ended. This date seems,
from what we know of the political situation in general, to be more
probable than the later one for the Thessalian campaign.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEOVIGILD,<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Löwenheld</span> (d. 586), king of the Visigoths,
became king in 568 after the short period of anarchy which
followed the death of King Athanagild, whose widow, Goisvintha,
he married. At first he ruled that part of the Visigothic kingdom
which lay to the south of the Pyrenees, his brother Liuva or
Leova governing the small part to the north of these mountains;
but in 572 Liuva died and Leovigild became sole king. At this
time the Visigoths who settled in Spain early in the 5th century
were menaced by two powerful enemies, the Suevi who had a
small kingdom in the north-west of the peninsula, and the
Byzantines who had answered Athanagild&rsquo;s appeal for help by
taking possession of a stretch of country in the south-east.
Their kingdom, too, was divided and weakened by the fierce
hostility between the orthodox Christians and those who professed
Arianism. Internal and external dangers alike, however,
failed to daunt Leovigild, who may fairly be called the restorer of
the Visigothic kingdom. He turned first against the Byzantines,
who were defeated several times; he took Cordova and
chastised the Suevi; and then by stern measures he destroyed
the power of those unruly and rebellious chieftains who had
reduced former kings to the position of ciphers. The chronicler
tells how, having given peace to his people, he, first of the Visigothic
sovereigns, assumed the attire of a king and made Toledo
his capital. He strengthened the position of his family and
provided for the security of his kingdom by associating his two
sons, Recared and Hermenegild, with himself in the kingly office
and placing parts of the land under their rule. Leovigild himself
was an Arian, being the last of the Visigothic kings to hold
that creed; but he was not a bitter foe of the orthodox Christians,
although he was obliged to punish them when they conspired
against him with his external enemies. His son Hermenegild,
however, was converted to the orthodox faith through the
influence of his Frankish wife, Ingundis, daughter of King
Sigebert I., and of Leander, metropolitan of Seville. Allying
himself with the Byzantines and other enemies of the Visigoths,
and supported by most of the orthodox Christians he headed
a formidable insurrection. The struggle was fierce; but at
length, employing persuasion as well as force, the old king
triumphed. Hermenegild was captured; he refused to give
up his faith and in March or April 585 he was executed. He was
canonized at the request of Philip II., king of Spain, by Pope
Sixtus V. About this time Leovigild put an end to the kingdom
of the Suevi. During his last years he was engaged in a war
with the Franks. He died at Toledo on the 21st of April 586 and
was succeeded by his son Recared.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEPANTO,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span><a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> <span class="bold">BATTLE OF,</span> fought on the 7th of October 1571.
The conquest of Cyprus by the Turks, and their aggressions on
the Christian powers, frightened the states of the Mediterranean
into forming a holy league for their common defence. The main
promoter of the league was Pope Pius V., but the bulk of the
forces was supplied by the republic of Venice and Philip II. of
Spain, who was peculiarly interested in checking the Turks
both because of the Moorish element in the population of Spain,
and because he was also sovereign of Naples and Sicily. In
compliment to King Philip, the general command of the league&rsquo;s
fleet was given to his natural brother, Don John of Austria.
It included, however, only twenty-four Spanish ships. The
great majority of the two hundred galleys and eight galeasses,
of which the fleet was composed, came from Venice, under the
command of the proveditore Barbarigo; from Genoa, which
was in close alliance with Spain, under Gianandrea Doria;
and from the Pope whose squadron was commanded by Marc
Antonio Colonna. The Sicilian and Neapolitan contingents
were commanded by the marquess of Santa Cruz, and Cardona,
Spanish officers. Eight thousand Spanish soldiers were embarked.
The allied fleet was collected slowly at Messina, from
whence it advanced by the passage between Ithaca and Cephalonia
to Cape Marathia near Dragonera. The Turkish fleet which had
come up from Cyprus and Crete anchored in the Gulf of Patras.
It consisted in all of 273 galleys which were of lighter build than
the Christians&rsquo;, and less well supplied with cannon or small arms.
The Turks still relied mainly on the bow and arrow. Ali, the
capitan pasha, was commander-in-chief, and he had with him
Chulouk Bey of Alexandria, commonly called Scirocco, and Uluch
Ali, dey of Algiers. On the 7th of October the Christian fleet
advanced to the neighbourhood of Cape Scropha. It was
formed in the traditional order of the galleys&mdash;a long line abreast,
subdivided into the centre or &ldquo;battle&rdquo; commanded by Don
John in person, the left wing under the proveditore Barbarigo,
and the right under Gianandrea Doria. But a reserve squadron
was placed behind the centre under the marquess of Santa Cruz,
and the eight lumbering galeasses were stationed at intervals in
front of the line to break the formation of the Turks. The
capitan pasha left his anchorage in the Gulf of Patras with his
fleet in a single line, without reserve or advance-guard. He was
himself in the centre, with Scirocco on his right and Uluch Ali
on his left. The two fleets met south of Cape Scropha, both drawn
up from north to south, the land being close to the left flank of
the Christians, and the right of the Turks. To the left of the
Turks and the right of the Christians, there was open sea. Ali
Pasha&rsquo;s greater numbers enabled him to outflank his enemy.
The Turks charged through the intervals between the galeasses,
which proved to be of no value. On their right Scirocco outflanked
the Venetians of Barbarigo, but the better build of the
galleys of Saint Mark and the admirable discipline of their
crews gave them the victory. The Turks were almost all sunk
or driven on shore. Scirocco and Barbarigo both lost their lives.
On the centre Don John and the capitan pasha met prow to prow&mdash;the
Christians reserving the fire of their bow guns (called <i>di
cursia</i>) till the moment of impact, and then boarding. Ali Pasha
was slain and his galley taken. Everywhere on the centre the
Christians gained the upper hand, but their victory was almost
turned into a defeat by the mistaken man&oelig;uvres of Doria.
In fear lest he should be outflanked by Uluch Ali, he stood
out to sea, leaving a gap between himself and the centre. The
dey of Algiers, who saw the opening, reversed the order of his
squadron, and fell on the right of the centre. The galleys of the
Order of Malta, which were stationed at this point, suffered
severely, and their flagship was taken with great slaughter.
A disaster was averted by the marquess of Santa Cruz, who
brought up the reserve. Uluch Ali then retreated with sail and
oar, bringing most of his division off in good order.</p>

<p>The loss of life in the battle was enormous, being put at
20,000 for the Turks and 8000 for the Christians. The battle of
Lepanto was of immense political importance. It gave the naval
power of the Turks a blow from which it never recovered,
and put a stop to their aggression in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Historically the battle is interesting because it was the last
example of an encounter on a great scale between fleets of galleys
and also because it was the last crusade. The Christian powers
of the Mediterranean did really combine to avert the ruin of
Christendom. Hardly a noble house of Spain or Italy was not
represented in the fleet, and the princes headed the boarders.
Volunteers came from all parts of Europe, and it is said that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>464</span>
among them was Sir Richard Grenville, afterwards famous for
his fight in the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; off Flores in the Azores. Cervantes
was undoubtedly present, and had his left hand shattered by a
Turkish bullet.</p>

LOUIS MICHEL</span> (1760-1793), French politician, was born on the
29th of May 1760 at Paris. He belonged to a well-known family,
his great-grandfather, Michel Robert Le Peletier des Forts,
count of Saint-Fargeau, having been controller-general of finance.
He inherited a great fortune, and soon became president of the
parlement of Paris and in 1789 he was a deputy of the <i>noblesse</i>
to the States-General. At this time he shared the conservative
views of the majority of his class; but by slow degrees his ideas
changed and became very advanced. On the 13th of July
1789 he demanded the recall of Necker, whose dismissal by the
king had aroused great excitement in Paris; and in the Constituent
Assembly he had moved the abolition of the penalty
of death, of the galleys and of branding, and the substitution
of beheading for hanging. This attitude won him great
popularity, and on the 21st of June 1790 he was made president
of the Constituent Assembly. During the existence of the
Legislative Assembly, he was president of the general council
for the department of the Yonne, and was afterwards elected
by this department as a deputy to the Convention. Here he
was in favour of the trial of Louis XVI. by the assembly and
voted for the death of the king. This vote, together with his
ideas in general, won him the hatred of the royalists, and on the
20th of January 1793, the eve of the execution of the king, he was
assassinated in the Palais Royal at Paris by a member of the
king&rsquo;s body-guard. The Convention honoured Le Peletier by a
magnificent funeral, and the painter J. L. David represented
his death in a famous picture, which was later destroyed by his
daughter. Towards the end of his life, Le Peletier had interested
himself in the question of public education; he left fragments
of a plan, the ideas contained in which were borrowed in later
schemes. His assassin fled to Normandy, where, on the point of
being discovered, he blew out his brains. Le Peletier had
a brother, Félix (1769-1837), well known for his advanced
ideas. His daughter, Suzanne Louise, was &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; by the
French nation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEPIDOLITE<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Lithia-Mica</span>, a mineral of the mica group
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mica</a></span>). It is a basic aluminium, potassium and lithium
fluo-silicate, with the approximate formula KLi [Al(OH, F)<span class="su">2</span>]
Al(SiO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">3</span>. Lithia and fluorine are each present to the extent
of about 5%; rubidium and caesium are sometimes present
in small amounts. Distinctly developed monoclinic crystals
or cleavage sheets of large size are of rare occurrence, the mineral
being usually found as scaly aggregates, and on this account
was named lepidolite (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="lepis">&#955;&#949;&#960;&#943;&#962;</span>, scale) by M. H. Klaproth
in 1792. It is usually of a lilac or peach-blossom colour, but is
sometimes greyish-white, and has a pearly lustre on the cleavage
surfaces. The hardness is 2½-4 and the sp. gr. 2.8-2.9, the optic
axial angle measures 50°-70°. It is found in pegmatite-veins,
often in association with pink tourmaline (rubellite) and sometimes
intergrown in parallel position with muscovite. Scaly
masses of considerable extent are found at Rozena near Bystrzitz
in Moravia and at Pala in San Diego county, California. The
material from Rozena has been known since 1791, and has sometimes
been cut and polished for ornamental purposes: it has a
pretty colour and spangled appearance and takes a good polish,
but is rather soft. At Pala it has been extensively mined for the
preparation of lithium and rubidium salts. Other localities
for the mineral are the island of Utö in Sweden, and Auburn
and Paris in Maine, U.S.A.; at Alabashka near Mursinka in the
Urals large isolated crystals have been found, and from Central
Australia transparent cleavage sheets of a fine lilac colour are
known.</p>

<p>The lithium-iron mica <i>zinnwaldite</i> or <i>lithionite</i> is closely allied
to lepidolite, differing from it in containing some ferrous iron
in addition to the constituents mentioned above. It occurs
as greyish silvery scales with hexagonal outlines in the tin-bearing
granites of Zinnwald in the Erzgebirge, Bohemia and of
Cornwall.</p>

cuticular structures&mdash;the scales (fig. 7)&mdash;that may be regarded
as modified arthropodan &ldquo;hairs.&rdquo; Such scales are not peculiar
to the Lepidoptera&mdash;they are found also on many of the Aptera,
on the Psocidae, a family of Corrodentia, on some Coleoptera
(beetles) and on the gnats (Culicidae), a family of Diptera. The
most distinctive structural features of the Lepidoptera are to
be found in the jaws. The mandibles are mere vestiges or
entirely absent; the second maxillae are usually reduced to a
narrow transverse mentum which bears the scale-covered
labial palps, between which project the elongate first maxillae,
grooved on their inner faces, so as to form when apposed a
tubular proboscis adapted for sucking liquid food.</p>

<p>All Lepidoptera are hatched as the eruciform soft-bodied
type of larva (fig. 1, <i>a</i>) known as the caterpillar, with biting
mandibles, three pairs of thoracic legs and with a variable
number (usually five pairs) of abdominal prolegs, which carry
complete or incomplete circles of hooklets. The pupa in a
single family only is free (<i>i.e.</i> with the appendages free from the
body), and mandibulate. In the vast majority of the order
it is more or less obtect (<i>i.e.</i> with the appendages fixed to the
cuticle of the body) and without mandibles (fig. 1, <i>c</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2"><i>Structure.</i>&mdash;The head in the Lepidoptera is sub-globular in shape
with the compound eyes exceedingly well developed, and with a
pair of ocelli or &ldquo;simple eyes&rdquo; often present on the vertex. It is
connected to the thorax by a relatively broad and membranous
&ldquo;neck.&rdquo; The feelers are many-jointed, often they are complex,
the segments bearing
processes arranged in
a comb-like manner
and furnished with
numerous sensory
hairs (fig. 2). The
complexity of the
feelers is carried to
its highest development
in certain male
moths that have a
wonderful power of
discovering their
females by smell or
some analogous sense.
Often the feelers are
excessively complex
in male moths whose
maxillae are so reduced
that they take
no food in the imaginal state. The nature of the jaws has already
been briefly described. Functional mandibles of peculiar form
(fig. 3, A) are present in the remarkable small moths of the genus
<i>Micropteryx</i> (or <i>Eriocephala</i>), and there are vestiges of these jaws
in other moths of low type, but the minute structures in the higher
Lepidoptera that were formerly described as mandibles are now
believed to belong to the labrum, the true mandibles being perhaps
represented by rounded prominences,
not articulated with the head-capsule.
Throughout the order, as a whole,
the jaws are adapted for sucking
liquid food, and the suctorial proboscis
(often erroneously called a
&ldquo;tongue&rdquo;) is formed as was shown
by J. C. Savigny in 1816 by two
elongated and flexible outgrowths of
the first maxillae, usually regarded
as representing the outer lobes or
galeae (fig. 4, A, B, <i>g</i>). These structures
are grooved along their inner
faces and by means of a series of
interlocking hair-like bristles can be
joined together so as to form a
tubular sucker (fig. 4, C). At their
extremities they are beset with club-like
sense-organs, whose apparent
function is that of taste. The proboscis
when in use is stretched out
in front of the head and inserted
into the corolla of a flower or elsewhere,
for the absorption of liquid
nourishment. When at rest, the
proboscis is rolled up into a close
spiral beneath the head and between the labial palps (fig. 4, A, <i>p</i>).
Only in the genus <i>Micropteryx</i> mentioned above is the lacinia
of the maxilla (as A. Walter has shown) developed (fig. 3, B, <i>c</i>).
The maxillary palp is usually a mere vestige (fig. 4, B, <i>p</i>) though
it is conspicuous in a few families of small moths. A considerable
number of Lepidoptera take no food in the imaginal state;
in these the maxillae are reduced or altogether atrophied. The
second maxillae are intimately fused together to form the labium,
which consists only
of a reduced mentum,
bearing sometimes
vestigial lobes
and always a pair of
palps. These have
two or three segments
and are
clothed with scales.
The form and direction
of the terminal
segment of the labial
palp afford valuable
characters in classification.</p>

<p class="pt2">In the thorax of
the Lepidoptera the
foremost segment or
prothorax is very
small, and not movable
on the mesothorax.
In many
families it carries a
pair of small erectile
plates&mdash;the patagia&mdash;which
have been
regarded as serially
homologous with the
wings. The mesothorax
is extensive;
its scutum forming
most of the dorsal
thoracic area and
small plates&mdash;tegulae&mdash;are
often
present at the base
of the forewings, as
in Hymenoptera.
The tegulae which
are beset with long
hair-like scales are
often conspicuous.
The metathorax is
smaller than the
mesothorax. The
legs are of the typical
hexapodan form
with five-segmented
feet; the shins often
bear terminal and median spurs articulated at their bases and the
entire limbs are clothed with scales.</p>

<p>The wings of the Lepidoptera may be said to dominate the structure
of the insect; only exceptionally, in certain female moths, are they
vestigial or absent (fig. 17). The forewing, with its prominent apex,
is longer than the
hindwing, and the
neuration in both
(see figs. 5 and 6) is
for the most part
longitudinal, only a
few transverse nervures,
which are, in
fact, branches of the
median trunk,
marking off a discoidal
areolet or
&ldquo;cell&rdquo; (fig. 5, <i>a</i>).
The five branches of
the radial nervure
(figs. 5, 6, <i>3</i>) (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hexapoda</a></span>) are
usually present in
the forewing, but
the hindwing, in
most families, has
only a single radial
nervure; its anal
area is, however,
often more strongly
developed than that
of the forewing. The
two wings of a side
are usually kept together during flight by a few stout bristles&mdash;the
frenulum&mdash;(fig. 5, <i>f</i>) projecting from the base of the costa of the
hindwing and fitting beneath a membranous fold or a few thickened
scales&mdash;the retinaculum&mdash;on the under surface of the forewing.
In butterflies there is no frenulum, but a costal outgrowth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
hindwing subserves the same function. In the most primitive
moths a small lobate outgrowth&mdash;the jugum (fig. 6, <i>j</i>.)&mdash;from the
dorsum of the forewing is present, but it can be of little service in
keeping the two wings together. A jugum may be also present on
the hindwing. The legs, which are generally used for clinging rather
than for walking, have five-segmented feet and are covered with
scales. In some families the front pair are reduced and without
tarsal segments.</p>

<p>Ten abdominal segments are recognizable in many Lepidoptera,
but the terminal segments are reduced or modified to form external
organs of reproduction. In
the male, according to the
interpretation of C. Peytoureau,
the lateral plates
belonging to the ninth segment
form paired claspers
beset with harpes, or series
of ridges or teeth, while the
tergum of the tenth segment
forms a dorsal hook&mdash;the
uncus&mdash;and its sternum
a ventral process or
scaphium. In the female
the terminal segments
form, in some cases, a
protrusible ovipositor, but
the typical hexapodan ovipositor
with its three pairs
of processes is undeveloped
in the Lepidoptera.</p>

<p>As already mentioned,
the characteristic scales on
the wings, legs and body
of the Lepidoptera are
cuticular structures. A
complete series of transitional
forms can be traced
between the most elaborate
flattened scales (fig. 7, B) with numerous longitudinal striae and a
simple arthropod &ldquo;hair.&rdquo; Either a &ldquo;hair&rdquo; or a scale owes its
origin to a special cell of the ectoderm (hypodermis), a process from
which grows through the general cuticle and forms around itself
the substance of the cuticular appendage. The scales on the wings
are arranged in regular rows (fig. 7, A), and the general cuticle is
drawn out into a narrow neck or collar around the base of each
scale. The scales can be easily rubbed from the surface of the wing,
and the series of collars in which the scales rest are then evident
(fig. 7, A, <i>c</i>) on the wing-membrane. On the wings of many male
butterflies there are specially modified scales&mdash;the androconia
(fig. 7, C)&mdash;which are formed by glandular cells and diffuse a scented
secretion. In some cases, the androconia are mixed among the
ordinary scales; in others they are associated into conspicuous
&ldquo;brands&rdquo; (see fig. 66). The admirable colours of the wings of the
Lepidoptera are due partly to pigment in the scales&mdash;as in the case
of yellows, browns, reds and blacks&mdash;partly to &ldquo;interference&rdquo;
effects from the fine striae on the
scales&mdash;as with the blues, purples and
greens.</p>

<p>A few points of interest in the internal
structure of the Lepidoptera
deserve mention. The mouth opens
into a sub-globular, muscular pharynx
which is believed to suck the liquid
food through the proboscis, and force
it along the slender gullet into a crop-like
enlargement or diverticulum of the
fore-gut known as a &ldquo;food-reservoir&rdquo;
or &ldquo;sucking-stomach.&rdquo; The true
stomach is tubular, and beyond it lies
the intestine into which open the three
pairs of excretory (Malpighian) tubes.
The terminal part of the intestine is
of wide diameter, and in some cases
gives off a short caecum. The brain
and the sub-oesophageal ganglia are
closely approximated; there are two
or three thoracic and four (rarely five) abdominal ganglia. In
the female each ovary has four ovarian tubes, in which the large
egg-cells are enclosed in follicles and associated with nutritive cells.
There is a special bursa which in the Hepialidae opens with the
vagina on the eighth abdominal sternum. In the Micropterygidae,
Enocraniidae and the lower Tineides, the duct of the bursa leads
into the vagina, which still opens on the eighth sternum. But in
most Lepidoptera, the bursa opens by a vestibule on the eighth
sternum, distinct from the vagina, whose opening shifts back to
the ninth, the duct of the bursa being connected with the vagina
by a canal which opens opposite to the spermatheca. In the male,
the two testes are usually fused into a single mass, and a pair of
tubular accessory glands open into the vasa deferentia or into the
ejaculatory duct. In a few families&mdash;the Hepialidae and Saturniidae
for example&mdash;the testes retain the primitive paired arrangement.
These details have been worked out by various students, among
whom W. H. Jackson and W. Petersen deserve special mention.
Summing up the developmental history of the genital ducts, Jackson
remarks that there is &ldquo;an Ephemeridal stage, which ends towards
the close of larval life, an Orthopteran stage, indicated during the
quiescent period preceding pupation, and a Lepidopteran stage
which begins with the commencement of pupal life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;Many observations have been made on the
embryology of the Lepidoptera; for some of the more important
results of these see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hexapoda</a></span>. The post-embryonic development
of Lepidoptera is more familiar, perhaps, than that of any
other group of animals. The egg shows great variation in its
outward form, the outer envelope or chorion being in some families
globular, in others flattened, in others again erect and sub-conical
or cylindrical; while its surface often exhibits a beautifully
regular series of ribs and furrows. Throughout the order the
larva is of the form known as the caterpillar (fig. 1, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, fig. 8 <span class="scs">B</span>)
characterized by the presence of three pairs of jointed and clawed
legs on the thorax and a variable number of pairs of abdominal
&ldquo;prolegs&rdquo;&mdash;sub-cylindrical outgrowths of the abdominal segments,
provided with a complete or incomplete circle of hooklets
at the extremity.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are ten abdominal segments&mdash;the ninth often small and
concealed; prolegs are usually present on the third, fourth, fifth,
sixth and tenth of these segments.
The head of the caterpillar (fig. 9)
is large with firmly chitinized cuticle;
it carries usually twelve simple eyes
or ocelli, a pair of short feelers (fig.
9 <i>At</i>) and a pair of strong mandibles
(fig. 9, <i>Mn</i>), for the caterpillar feeds
by biting leaves or other plant-tissues.
The first maxillae, so highly
developed in the imago, are in the
larva small and inconspicuous appendages,
each bearing two short
jointed processes,&mdash;the galea and
the palp (fig. 9, <i>Mx</i>). The second
maxillae form a plate-like labium
on whose surface projects the
spinneret which is usually regarded
as a modified hypopharynx (fig. 9,
<i>Lm</i>). The silk-glands whose ducts
open on this spinneret are paired
convoluted tubes lying alongside
the elongate cylindrical stomach.
In the common &ldquo;silkworm&rdquo; these
glands are five times as long as the
body of the caterpillar. They are regarded
as modified salivary glands,
though the correspondence has been doubted by some students. The
body of the caterpillar is usually cylindrical and wormlike, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>
segmentation well marked and the cuticle feebly chitinized and
flexible. Firm chitinous plates are, however, not seldom present on
the prothorax and on the hindmost abdominal segment. The segments
are mostly provided with bristle or spine-bearing tubercles,
whose arrangement has lately been shown by H. G. Dyar to give
partially trustworthy indications of relationship. On either side
of the median line we find two dorsal or trapezoidal tubercles (Nos. 1
and 2), while around the spiracle are grouped (Nos. 3, 4 and 5)
supra-, post-, and pre-spiracular tubercles; below are the sub-spiraculars,
of which there may be two (Nos. 6, 7). The last-named
is situated on the base of the abdominal proleg, and yet another
tubercle (No. 8) may be present on the inner aspect of the proleg.
The spiracles are very conspicuous on the body of a caterpillar,
occurring on the prothorax and on the first eight abdominal segments.
Various tubercles may become coalesced or aborted (fig.
10, B); often, in conjunction with the spines that they bear, the
tubercles serve as a valuable protective armature for the caterpillar.
Much discussion has taken place as to whether the abdominal prolegs
are or are not developed directly from the embryonic abdominal
appendages. In the more lowly families of Lepidoptera, these
organs are provided at the extremity with a complete circle of
hooklets, but in the more highly organized families, only the inner
half of this circle is retained.</p>

<p class="pt2">The typical Lepidopteran pupa, or &ldquo;chrysalis,&rdquo; as shown in the
higher families, is an obtect pupa (fig. 11) with no trace of mandibles,
the appendages being glued to the body by an exudation, and
motion being possible only at three of the abdominal intersegmental
regions, the fifth and sixth abdominal segments at most being &ldquo;free.&rdquo;
A flattened or pointed process&mdash;the cremaster&mdash;often prominent at
the tail-end, may carry one or several hooks (fig. 1, <i>d</i>) which serve
to anchor the pupa to its cocoon or to suspend butterfly-pupae
from their pad of silk (fig. 11). In the lower families the pupa
(fig. 1, <i>c</i>) is only incompletely obtect, and a greater number of
abdominal segments can move on one another. The seventh abdominal
segment is, in all female lepidopterous pupae, fused with
those behind it; in the male &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; pupa this becomes
&ldquo;free&rdquo; and so may the segments anterior to it, in both sexes, forward
to and including the third. The presence of circles of spines
on the abdominal segments enables the &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; pupa as a
whole to work its way partly out of the cocoon when the time for
the emergence of the imago draws near. In the family of the
Eriocraniidae (often called the Micropterygidae) the pupa resembles
that of a caddis-fly (<i>Trichopteron</i>) being active before the emergence
of the imago and provided with strong mandibles by means of which
it bites its way out of the cocoon. The importance of the pupa in
the phylogeny and classification of the Lepidoptera has lately been
demonstrated by T. A. Chapman in a valuable series of papers.
Sometimes organs are present in the pupa which are undeveloped in
the imago, such as the maxillary palps of the Sesiidae (clearwing
moths) and the pectination on the feelers of female Saturniids.
E. B. Poulton has drawn attention to the ancestral value of such
characters.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Habits and Life-Relations.</i>&mdash;The attractiveness of the Lepidoptera
and the conspicuous appearance of many of them have led to
numerous observations on their habits. The method of feeding
of the imago by the suction of liquids has already been mentioned
in connexion with the structure of the maxillae and the food-canal.
Nectar from flowers is the usual food of moths and
butterflies, most of which alight on a blossom before thrusting
the proboscis into the corolla of the flower, while others&mdash;the
hawk moths (Sphingidae) for example&mdash;remain poised in the
air in front of the flower by means of excessively rapid vibration
of the wings, and quickly unrolling the proboscis sip the nectar.
Certain flowers with remarkably long tubular corollas seem to be
specially adapted for the visits of hawk moths. Some Lepidoptera
have other sources of food-supply. The juices of fruit are often
sought for, and certain moths can pierce the envelope of a
succulent fruit with the rough cuticular outgrowths at the tips
of the maxillae, so as to reach the soft tissue within. Animal
juices attract other Lepidoptera, which have been observed
to suck blood from a wounded mammal; while putrid meat
is a familiar &ldquo;lure&rdquo; for the gorgeous &ldquo;purple emperor&rdquo; butterfly
(<i>Apatura iris</i>). The water of streams or the dew on leaves may be
frequently sought by Lepidoptera desirous of quenching their
thirst, possibly with fatal results, the insects being sometimes
drowned in rivers in large numbers. Members of several families
of the Lepidoptera&mdash;the Hepialidae, Lasiocampidae and
Saturniidae, for example&mdash;have the maxillae vestigial or aborted,
and take no food at all after attaining the winged condition.
In such insects there is a complete &ldquo;division of labour&rdquo; between
the larval and the imaginal instars, the former being entirely
devoted to nutritive, the latter to reproductive functions.</p>

<p>Of much interest is the variety displayed among the Lepidoptera
in the season and the duration of the various instars. The
brightly coloured vanessid butterflies, for example, emerge from
the pupa in the late summer and live through the winter in
sheltered situations, reappearing to lay their eggs in the succeeding
spring. Many species, such as the vapourer moths (<i>Orgyia</i>),
lay eggs in the autumn, which remain unhatched through the
winter. The eggs of the well-known magpie moths (<i>Abraxas</i>)
hatch in autumn and the caterpillar hibernates while still quite
small, awaiting for its growth the abundant food-supply to be
afforded by the next year&rsquo;s foliage. The codlin moths (<i>Carpocapsa</i>)
pass the winter as resting full-grown larvae, which seek
shelter and spin cocoons in autumn, but do not pupate until the
succeeding spring. Lastly, many of the Lepidoptera hibernate
in the pupal stage; the death&rsquo;s head moth (<i>Acherontia</i>) and the
cabbage-white butterflies (<i>Pieris</i>) are familiar examples of such.
The last-named insects afford instances of the &ldquo;double-brooded&rdquo;
condition, two complete life-cycles being passed through in the
year. The flour moth (<i>Ephestia kühniella</i>) is said to have five
successive generations in a twelvemonth. On the other hand,
certain species whose larvae feed in wood or on roots take two
or three years to reach the adult stage.</p>

<p>The rate of growth of the larva depends to a great extent on
the nature of its food, and the feeding-habits of caterpillars
afford much of interest and variety to the student. The contrast
among the Lepidoptera between the suctorial mouth of the
imago and the biting jaws of the caterpillar is very striking (cf.
figs. 4 and 9), and the profound transformation in structure
which takes place is necessarily accompanied by the change from
solid to liquid food. The first meal of a young caterpillar is well
known to be often its empty egg-shell; from this it turns to feed
upon the leaves whereon its provident parent has laid her eggs.
But in a few cases hatching takes place in winter or early spring,
and the young larvae have then to find a temporary food until
their own special plant is available. For example, the caterpillars
of some species of <i>Xanthia</i> and other noctuid moths feed
at first upon willow-catkins. On the other hand, the caterpillars
of the pith moth (<i>Blastodacna</i>) hatched at midsummer, feed on
leaves when young, and burrow into woody shoots in autumn.
All who have tried to rear caterpillars know that, while those of
some species will feed only on one particular species of plant,
others will eat several species of the same genus or family, while
others again are still less particular, some being able to feed on
almost any green herb. It is curious to note how certain species
change their food in different localities, a caterpillar confined to
one plant in some localities being less particular elsewhere.
Individual aberrations in food are of special interest in suggesting
the starting-point for a change in the race. When we consider
the vast numbers of the Lepidoptera and the structural modifications
which they have undergone, their generally faithful
adherence to a vegetable diet is remarkable. The vast majority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>468</span>
of caterpillars eat leaves, usually devouring them openly, and,
if of large size, quickly reducing the amount of foliage on the plant.
But many small caterpillars keep, apparently for the sake of
concealment, to the under surface of the leaf, while others burrow
into the green tissue, forming a characteristic sinuous &ldquo;mine&rdquo;
between the two leaf-skins. In several families we find the
habit of burrowing in woody stems,&mdash;the &ldquo;goat&rdquo; (<i>Cossus</i>, fig. 8)
and the clearwings (Sesiidae), for example, while others, like
the larvae of the swift moths (Hepialidae) live underground
devouring roots (fig. 12). The richer nutrition in the green food
is usually shown by the quicker growth of the numerous caterpillars
that feed on it, as compared with the slower development
of the wood and root-feeding species. Aquatic larvae are very
rare among the Lepidoptera. The caterpillars of the pyralid
&ldquo;china-mark&rdquo; moths (<i>Hydrocampa</i>, fig. 13), however, live
under water, feeding on duckweed (<i>Lemna</i>) and breathing
atmospheric air, a film of which is enclosed in a spun-up shelter
beneath the leaves, while the larvae of <i>Paraponyx</i>, which feed
on <i>Stratiotes</i>, have closed spiracles and breathe dissolved air
by means of branchial filaments along the sides of the body.</p>

<p>We may now turn to instances of more anomalous modes of
feeding. The clothes moths (Tineids) have invaded our dwellings
and found a congenial food-stuff for their larvae in our garments.
A few small species of the same group are reared in meal and
other human food-stores; so are the caterpillars of some pyralid
moths (<i>Ephestia</i>), while others (<i>Asopia</i>, <i>Aglossa</i>) feed upon
kitchen refuse. Two species of crambid moths (<i>Aphomia
sociella</i> and <i>Galleria melonella</i>) find a home in bee-hives, where
their caterpillars feed upon the wax, while the waxy secretion
from the body of the great American lantern-fly (<i>Fulgora
candelaria</i>) serves both as shelter and food for the caterpillar of
the moth <i>Epipyrops anomala</i>. Very few caterpillars have
developed a thoroughly carnivorous habit. That of <i>Cosmia
trapezina</i> feeds on oak and other leaves, but devours smaller
caterpillars which happen to get in its way, and if shaken from
the tree, eats other larvae while climbing the trunk. <i>Xylina
ornithopus</i> and a few other species are said to be always carnivorous
when opportunity offers; the small looping caterpillar
of a &ldquo;pug&rdquo; moth (<i>Eupithecia coronata</i>) has been observed to eat
a larva three times as big as itself. The caterpillars of <i>Orthosia
pistacina</i> live together in peace while their food is moist, but
devour each other when it dries up; this is true cannibalism&mdash;a
term which should not be applied to the habit of preying on
another species. A few carnivorous caterpillars do not attack
other caterpillars, but prey upon insects of another order; among
these <i>Fenescia tarquinius</i>, which eats aphides, and <i>Erastria
scitula</i>, which feeds upon scale insects, must be reckoned as benefactors
to mankind. The life-history of the latter moth has been
worked out by H. Rouzaud. It inhabits the shores of the Mediterranean,
and its caterpillar devours the coccids upon various
fruit-trees, especially the black-scale (<i>Lecanium oleae</i>) of the
olive. The moth, which is a small noctuid, the white markings
on whose wings give it the appearance of a bird-dropping
when at rest in the daytime, appears in May, and lays her eggs,
singly and far apart, upon the trees infested by the coccids.
when hatched, the young caterpillar selects a large female
coccid, eats its way through the scale, and devours the insect
beneath; having done this it makes its way to a fresh victim.
As it increases in size it forms a case for itself made of the scales
of its victims, excrement, &amp;c., bound together by silk which it
spins, and, protected by this covering, which closely resembles
the smut-covered bark of the tree, it roams about during its
later stages, devouring several coccids every day. So nutritious
is the food, that four or five successive broods follow each other
through the summer.</p>

<p>The habit just mentioned of forming some kind of protective
covering out of foreign substances spun together by silk is
practised by caterpillars of different families. The clothes moth
larvae (<i>Tinea</i>, fig. 14), for example, make a tubular dwelling out
of the pellets of wool passed from their own intestines, while the
allied Tortricid caterpillars roll up leaves and spin for themselves
cylindrical shelters. The habit of spinning over the food plant
a protective mass of web, whereon the caterpillars of a family
can live together socially is not uncommon. In the case of the
small ermine moths (<i>Hyponomeuta</i>) the caterpillars remain
associated throughout their lives and pupate in cocoons on the
mass of web produced by their common labour. But the larger,
spiny caterpillars of the vanessid butterflies usually scatter away
from the nest of their infancy when they have attained a certain
size.</p>

<p>Spines and hairs seem to be often effective protections for
caterpillars; the experiments of E. B. Poulton and others tend to
show that hairy caterpillars (fig. 15) are distasteful to birds.
Many caterpillars are protected by the harmony of their general
green coloration with their surroundings. When the insect attains
a large size&mdash;as in the case of the hawk moth (Sphingid) caterpillars&mdash;the
extensive
green surface becomes
broken up by diagonal
dark markings (fig.
46<i>b</i>), thus simulating
the effect of light and
shade among the foliage.
A remarkable
result of Poulton&rsquo;s
experiments has been
the establishment of a
reflex effect through the skin on the colour of a caterpillar. Some
species of &ldquo;loopers&rdquo; (Geometridae, fig. 43) for example, if placed
when young among surroundings of a certain colour, become
closely assimilated thereto&mdash;dark brown among dark twigs,
green among green leaves. These colour-reflexes in conjunction
with the elongate twig-like shape of the caterpillars and their
habit of stretching themselves straight out from a branch, afford
some of the best and most familiar examples of &ldquo;protective
resemblance.&rdquo; The &ldquo;terrifying attitude&rdquo; of caterpillars, and
the supposed resemblance borne by some of them to serpents and
other formidable vertebrates or arthropods, are discussed in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mimicry</a></span>.</p>

<p>The silk produced by a caterpillar is, as we have seen, often
advantageous in its own life-relations, but its great use is in
connexion with the pupal stage. In the life-history of many
Lepidoptera, the last act of the caterpillar is to spin a cocoon
which may afford protection to the pupa. In some cases this is
formed entirely of the silk produced by the spinning-glands, and
may vary from the loose meshwork that clothes the pupa of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>469</span>
diamond-back moth (<i>Plutella cruciferarum</i>) to the densely woven
cocoon of the silkworms (Bombycidae and Saturniidae) or the
hard shell-like covering of the eggars (Lasiocampidae). Frequently
foreign substances are worked up with the silk and serve
to strengthen the cocoon, such as hairs from the body of the
caterpillar itself, as among the &ldquo;tigers&rdquo;
(Arctiidae) or chips of wood, as with
the timber-burrowing larva of the
&ldquo;goat&rdquo; (<i>Cossus</i>). In many families
of Lepidoptera we can trace a degeneration
of the cocoon. Thus, the pupae
of most owl moths (Noctuidae) and
hawk moths (Sphingidae) lie buried in
an earthen cell. Among the butterflies
we find that the cocoon is reduced to a
pad of silk which gives attachment to
the cremaster; in the Pieridae there is
in addition a girdle of silk around the
waist-region of the pupa, but the pupae
of the Nymphalidae (figs. 11, 65)
simply hang from the supporting pad
by the tail-end. Poulton has shown
that the colours of some exposed
pupae vary with the nature of the
surroundings of the larva during the
final stage.</p>

<p>When the pupal stage is complete
the insect has to make its way out of
the cocoon. In the lower families of moths it is the pupa
which comes out at least partially, working itself onwards
by the spines on its abdominal segments; the pupa of the
primitive <i>Micropteryx</i> has functional mandibles with which it
bites through the cocoon. In the higher Lepidoptera the pupa is
immovable, and the imago, after the ecdysis of the pupal cuticle,
must emerge. This emergence is in some cases facilitated by the
secretion of an acid or alkaline solvent discharged from the mouth
or from the hind-gut, which weakens the cocoon&mdash;so that the
delicate moth can break through without injury.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the conditions to which larva and
pupa are subjected have often a marked influence on the nature
of the imago. An indifferent food-supply for the larva leads
to a dwarfing of the moth or butterfly. Many converging lines
of experiment and observation tend to show that cool conditions
during the pupal stage frequently induce darkening of pigment
in the imago, while a warm temperature brightens the colours
of the perfect insect. For example, in many species of butterfly
that are double-brooded, the spring brood emerging from the
wintering pupae are more darkly coloured than the summer
brood, but if the pupae producing the latter be subjected artificially
to cold conditions, the winter form of imago results. It is
usually impossible, however, to produce the summer form of
the species from wintering pupae by artificial heat. From this
A. Weismann argued that the more stable winter form must be
regarded as representing the ancestral race of the species.
Further examples of this &ldquo;seasonal dimorphism&rdquo; are afforded
by many tropical butterflies which possess a darker &ldquo;wet-season&rdquo;
and a brighter &ldquo;dry-season&rdquo; generation. So different in
appearance are often these two seasonal forms that before their
true relationship was worked out they had been naturally
regarded as independent species. The darkening of wing-patterns
in many species of Lepidoptera has been carefully
studied in our own British fauna. Melanic or melanochroic
varieties are specially characteristic of western and hilly regions,
and some remarkable dark races (fig. 43) of certain geometrid
moths have arisen and become perpetuated in the manufacturing
districts of the north of England. The production of these
melanic forms is explained by J. W. Tutt and others as largely
due to the action of natural selection, the damp and sooty
conditions of the districts where they occur rendering unusually
dark the surfaces&mdash;such as rocks, tree-trunks and palings&mdash;on
which moths habitually rest and so favouring the survival
of dark, and the elimination of pale varieties, as the latter
would be conspicuous to their enemies. Breeding experiments
have shown that these melanic races are sometimes &ldquo;dominant&rdquo;
to their parent-stock. An evidently adaptive connexion can
be frequently traced between the resting situation and attitude
of the insect and the colour and pattern of its wings. Moths
that rest with the hindwings concealed beneath the forewings
(fig. 34, <i>f</i>) often have the latter dull and mottled, while the
former are sometimes highly coloured. Butterflies whose
normal resting attitude is with the wings closed vertically
over the back (fig. 63) so that the under surface is exposed to
view, often have this under surface mottled and inconspicuous
although the upper surface may be bright with flashing colours.
Various degrees of such &ldquo;protective resemblance&rdquo; can be traced,
culminating in the wonderful &ldquo;imitation&rdquo; of its surroundings
shown by the tropical &ldquo;leaf-butterflies&rdquo; (<i>Kallima</i>), the under
surfaces of whose wings, though varying greatly, yet form in
every case a perfect representation of a leaf in some stage or
other of decay, the butterfly at the same time disposing of the
rest of its body so as to bear out the deception. How this is
effected is best told by A. R. Wallace, who was the first to
observe it, in his work <i>The Malay Archipelago</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The habit of the species is always to rest on a twig and among
dead or dried leaves, and in this position, with the wings closely
pressed together, their outline is exactly that of a moderately sized
leaf slightly curved or shrivelled. The tail of the hindwings forms
a perfect stalk and touches the stick, while the insect is supported
by the middle pair of legs, which are not noticed among the twigs
and fibres that surround it. The head and antennae are drawn
back between the wings so as to be quite concealed, and there is a
little notch hollowed out at the very base of the wings, which allows
the head to be retracted sufficiently.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">But the British Vanessids often rest on a bare patch of ground
with the brightly coloured upper surface of their wings fully
exposed to view, and even make themselves still more conspicuous
by fanning their wings up and down. Some genera and families
of Lepidoptera, believed to secrete noxious juices that render
them distasteful, are adorned with the staring contrasts of
colour usually regarded as &ldquo;warning,&rdquo; while other genera,
belonging to harmless families sought for as food by birds and
lizards, are believed to obtain complete or partial immunity
by their likeness to the conspicuous noxious groups. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mimicry</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Sexual dimorphism is frequent among the Lepidoptera.
In many families this takes the form of more elaborate feelers
in the male than in the female moth. Such complex feelers
(fig. 2) bear numerous sensory (olfactory) nerve-endings and
give to the males that possess them a wonderful power of discovering
their mates. A single captive female of the Endromidae
or Lasiocampidae often causes hundreds of males of her species
to &ldquo;assemble&rdquo; around her prison, and this character is made
use of by collectors who want to secure specimens. In many
butterflies&mdash;notably the &ldquo;blues&rdquo; (Lycaenidae)&mdash;the male is
brilliant while the female is dull, and in other groups (the
Danainae for example) he is provided with scent-producing
glands believed to be &ldquo;alluring&rdquo; in function. The apparent
evidence given by the sexual differences among the Lepidoptera
in favour of C. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of sexual selection finds no
support from a study of their habits. The male indeed usually
seeks the female, but
she appears to exercise
no choice in pairing. In
some cases the female is
attracted by the male,
and here a modified
form of sexual selection
appears to be operative.
The ghost swift
moth (<i>Hepialus humuli</i>)
affords a curious and
interesting example of this condition, the female showing the
usual brown and buff coloration of her genus, while the wings
of the male are pure white, rendering him conspicuous in the
dusky evening when pairing takes place. But in the northernmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>470</span>
haunts of the species, where there is no midsummer night,
the male closely resembles the female in wing patterns, the
development of the conspicuous white being needless. A very
interesting sexual dimorphism is seen in the wingless condition
of several female moths&mdash;the winter moths (<i>Hybernia</i> and
<i>Cheimatobia</i>) among the Geometridae and the vapourers (<i>Orgyia</i>
and <i>Ocneria</i>) among the Lymantriidae for example (fig. 17).
It might be thought that the loss of power of flight by the female
would seriously restrict the range of the species. In such
insects, however, the caterpillars are often active and travel far.</p>

<p><i>Distribution and Migration.</i>&mdash;The range of the Lepidoptera
is practically world-wide; they are absent from the most remote
and inhospitable of the arctic and antarctic lands, but even
Kerguelen possesses a few small indigenous moths. Many of
the large and dominant families have a range wide as that of the
order, and certain species that have attached themselves to
man&mdash;like the meal moths and the clothes moths&mdash;have become
almost cosmopolitan. Interesting and suggestive restrictions
of range can, however, be often traced. Although butterflies
have been found in 82° N. latitude in Greenland, they are
unknown in Iceland, and only a few species of the group reach
New Zealand. Three large sections&mdash;the Ithomiinae, Heliconiinae
and Brassolinae&mdash;of the great butterfly family Nymphalidae
are peculiar to the Neotropical region, while the Morphinae,
a characteristically South American group, have a few Oriental
genera in India and Indo-Malaya. The Acraeinae, another
section of the same family, have the vast majority of their
species in Ethiopian Africa, but are represented eastwards in
the Oriental and Australian regions and westwards in South
America. A comparison of the lepidopterous faunas of Ireland,
Great Britain and the European continent is very instructive,
and suggests strongly that, despite their power of flight the
Lepidoptera are mostly dependent on land-connexions for the
extension of their range. For example, Ireland has only forty
of the seventy species of British butterflies. The range of
many Lepidoptera is of course determined by the distribution
of the plants on which their larvae feed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless certain species of powerful flight, and some
that might be thought feeble on the wing, often cross sea-channels
and establish or reinforce distant colonies. Caterpillars of the
great death&rsquo;s head moth (<i>Acherontia atropos</i>) are found every
summer feeding in British and Irish potato fields, but it is doubtful
if any of the pupae resulting from them survive the winter
in our climate. It is believed by Tutt that the species is only
maintained by a fresh immigration of moths from the South
each summer. Hosts of white butterflies (<i>Pieris</i>) have been
frequently observed crossing the English Channel from France
to Kent. Migrating swarms of Lepidoptera have often been
met by sailors in mid-ocean; thus, Tutt records the presence
around a sailing ship in the Atlantic of such a swarm of the
rather feeble moth <i>Deiopeia pulchella</i>, nearly 1000 m. from its
nearest known habitat. This migratory instinct is connected
with the gregarious habits of many Lepidoptera. For example,
H. W. Bates states that at one place in South America he
noticed eighty different species flying about in enormous numbers
in the sunshine, and these, with few exceptions, were males,
the females remaining within the forest shades. Darwin describes
a &ldquo;butterfly shower,&rdquo; which he observed 10 m. off the South
American coast, extending as far as the eye could reach;
&ldquo;even by the aid of the telescope,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;it was not possible
to see a space free from butterflies.&rdquo; Sir J. Emerson Tennent,
witnessed in Ceylon a mighty host of butterflies of white or pale
yellow hue, &ldquo;apparently miles in breadth and of such prodigious
extension as to occupy hours and even days uninterruptedly
in their passage.&rdquo; Observations at Heligoland by H. Gätke
have shown that migrating moths &ldquo;travel under the same
conditions as migrating birds, and for the most part in their
company, in an east to west direction; they fly in swarms,
the numbers of which defy all attempts at computation and
can only be expressed by millions.&rdquo; The painted lady butterfly
(<i>Pyrameis cardui</i>) comes in repeated swarms from the Mediterranean
region into northern and western Europe, while in North
America companies of the monarch (<i>Anosia archippus</i>) invade
Canada every summer from the United States, and are believed
to return southwards in autumn. This latter species has, during
the last half-century, extended its range south-westwards
across the Pacific and reached the Austro-Malayan islands,
while several specimens have occurred in southern and western
England, though it has not established itself on this side of the
Atlantic. It is noteworthy that the introduction of its food-plant&mdash;<i>Asclepias</i>&mdash;into
the Sandwich Islands in 1850 apparently
enabled it to spread across the Pacific.</p>

<p><i>Fossil History.</i>&mdash;Our knowledge of the geological history of
the Lepidoptera is but scanty. Certain Oolitic fossil insects
from the lithographic stone of Solenhofen, Bavaria, have been
described as moths, but it is only in Tertiary deposits that
undoubted Lepidoptera occur, and these, all referable to existing
families, are very scarce. Most of them come from the Oligocene
beds of Florissant, Colorado, and have been described by S. H.
Scudder. The paucity of Lepidoptera among the fossils is not
surprising when we consider the delicacy of their structure, and
though their past history cannot be traced back beyond early
Cainozoic times, we can have little doubt from the geographical
distribution of some of the families that the order originated
with the other higher Endopterygota in the Mesozoic epoch.</p>

<p><i>Classification.</i>&mdash;The order Lepidoptera contains more than
fifty families, the discussion of whose mutual relationships has
given rise to much difference of opinion. The generally received
distinction is between butterflies or <i>Rhopalocera</i> (Lepidoptera
with clubbed feelers, whose habit is to fly by day) and moths or
<i>Heterocera</i> (Lepidoptera with variously shaped feelers, mostly
crepuscular or nocturnal in habit). This distinction is quite
untenable as a zoological conception, for the relationship of
butterflies to some moths is closer than that of many families
of Heterocera to each other. Still more objectionable is the
division of the order into <i>Macrolepidoptera</i> (including the butterflies
and large moths) and the <i>Microlepidoptera</i> (comprising the
smaller moths). Most of the recent suggestions for the division
of the Lepidoptera into sub-orders depend upon some single
character. Thus J. H. Comstock has proposed to separate the
three lowest families, which have&mdash;like caddis-flies (Trichoptera)&mdash;a
jugum on each forewing, as a suborder <i>Jugatae</i>, distinct
from all the rest of the Lepidoptera&mdash;the <i>Frenatae</i>, mostly possessing
a frenulum on the hindwing. A. S. Packard places one
family (Micropterygidae) with functional mandibles and a
lacinia in the first maxilla alone in a suborder <i>Laciniata</i>, all the
rest of the order forming the suborder <i>Haustellata</i>. T. A.
Chapman divides the families with free or incompletely obtect
and mobile pupae (<i>Incompletae</i>) from those with obtect pupae
which never leave the cocoon (<i>Obtectae</i>), and this is probably the
most natural primary division of the Lepidoptera that has as
yet been suggested. Dyar puts forward a classification founded
entirely on the structure of the larva, while Tutt divides the
Lepidoptera into three great stirps characterized by the shape
of the chorion of the egg. The primitive form of the egg is oval,
globular, or flattened with the micropyle at one end; from this
has apparently been derived the upright form of egg with the
micropyle on top which characterizes the butterflies and the
higher moths. These schemes, though helpful in pointing out
important differences, are unnatural in that they lay stress on
single, often adaptive, characters to the exclusion of others
equally important. Although it is perhaps best to establish no
division among the Lepidoptera between the order and the family,
an attempt has been made in the classification adopted in this
article to group the families into tribes or super-families which
may indicate their probable affinities. The systematic work
of G. F. Hampson, A. R. Grote and E. Meyrick has done much
to place the classification of the Lepidoptera on a sound basis,
so far as the characters of the imago are concerned, but attention
must also be paid to the preparatory stages if a truly natural
system is to be reached.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Jugatae.</i></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Three families are included in this group having in common
certain primitive characters of the wings and neuration (see fig. 6),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>471</span>
as well as of the larva and pupa. There is a membranous lobe or
jugum near the base of the wing, and the neuration of the hindwing
is closely like that of the forewing, the radial nervure being five-branched
in both. The pupa has four or five movable segments, and
the larval prolegs have complete circles of hooklets.</p>

<p>The three families of the Jugatae are not very closely related to
each other. The <i>Micropterygidae</i> (often known as <i>Eriocephalidae</i>),
comprising a few small moths with metallic wings, are the most
primitive of all Lepidoptera. They are provided with functional
mandibles, while the maxillae have distinct laciniae, well-developed
palps and galeae not modified for suction (see fig. 3). The larva is
remarkable on account of its long feelers, the presence of pairs of
jointed prolegs on the first eight abdominal segments, an anal sucker
beneath the last segment and bladder-like outgrowths on the cuticle.
These curious larvae feed on wet moss. The family has only a few
genera scattered widely over the earth&rsquo;s surface (Europe, America,
Australia, New Zealand).</p>

<p>The <i>Eriocraniidae</i> resemble the Micropterygidae in appearance,
but the imago has no mandibles, and the maxillae, though short
and provided with conspicuous palps, have no laciniae and form a
proboscis as in Lepidoptera generally. The abdomen of the female
carries a serrate piercing process, and the eggs are laid in the leaves
of deciduous trees, the white larvae, with aborted legs, mining in the
leaf tissue. The fully-fed larva winters in an underground cocoon
and then changes into the most remarkable of all known lepidopterous
pupae, with relatively enormous toothed mandibles which bite
a way out of the cocoon in preparation for the final change. These
pupal mandibles of the Eriocraniidae, together with the nature of the
imaginal maxillae in the Micropterygidae (Eriocephalidae) and the
wing-neuration in both families, point strongly to a relationship
between the Lepidoptera and the Trichoptera.</p>

<p>The <i>Hepialidae</i> or swift moths&mdash;the third family of the Jugatae&mdash;are
in some respects specialized. The moths are of large or moderate
size with the maxillae in a vestigial condition, no food being taken
after the attainment of the perfect state. The larvae (fig. 12) feed
either on roots or in the wood of trees and shrubs, not attaining
their growth in less than a year and some large exotic species living
for two or three. The family is world-wide in range, and Australia
possesses some almost gigantic and strangely coloured genera.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Tineides.</i></p>

<p>A large assemblage of moths, mostly of small size, are included
in this group. The wings have no jugum, but there is a frenulum
on the hindwing, which has, as in all the groups above the Jugatae,
only a single radial nervure. Three anal nervures are present in the
hindwing in those families whose wings are well developed, but in
several families of small moths the wings of both pairs are very
narrow and pointed, and the neuration is consequently reduced.
The sub-costal nervure of the hindwing is usually present and
distinct from the radial nervure. The egg is flat except in the
Cossidae and Castniidae in which it is upright. The larval prolegs,
with few exceptions, have a complete circle of hooklets, and the
larvae usually feed in some concealed situation. The pupa is incompletely
obtect, with three (in some females only two) to five free
abdominal segments, and emerges partly from the cocoon before
the moth appears. The cremaster serves to anchor the pupa to its
cocoon at the correct degree of emergence, and thus facilitates the
eclosion of the imago.</p>

<p>The <i>Cossidae</i> are a small family of large moths (figs. 8, 18, 19)
belonging to this section, characterized by their heads with erect
rough scales or hairs, the pectinate feelers of the males, their reduced
maxillae so that no food is taken in the perfect state, and their
wings with the fifth radial nervure arising from the third, and the
main median nervure forking in the discoidal areolet. The larvae
feed in plant stems, often in the wood of trees, forming tunnels and
galleries, and usually taking a year or more to reach maturity.
The pupa which has three or four free segments in the male and four
or five in the female, rests in a cocoon within the food plant, often
strengthened by chips of wood, or in a subterranean cocoon. The
family is fairly well represented in the tropics; the British fauna
possesses only three species, of which the &ldquo;goat&rdquo; (<i>Cossus cossus</i>)
and the &ldquo;leopard&rdquo; (<i>Zeuzera pyrina</i>) are well known, the caterpillars
of both being often injurious to timber and fruit trees.</p>

<p>The <i>Tortricidae</i> are a large family of small moths (see fig. 1),
nearly allied to the Cossidae. The fifth radial nervure does not
arise from the third, the maxillae are well developed, but their
palps are obsolete; the head is densely clothed with erect scales;
the terminal segment of the labial palp is short and obtuse. The
female pupa has three, the male four, free segments. All the larvae
of these moths have some method of concealing themselves while
feeding. A frequent plan is to roll up a leaf of the food-plant,
fastening the twisted portion with silken threads so as to make
a tubular retreat; this is the habit of the caterpillar of the green
bell moth (<i>Tortrix viridana</i>) which often ravages the foliage of oak
plantations. The larvae of the pine-shoot moths (<i>Retinia</i>) shelter
in solidified resinous exudations from their coniferous food-plants,
while the codlin-moth caterpillar (<i>Carpocapsa pomonella</i>) feeds in
apples and pears, growing with the growth of the fruit which affords
them both provender and home. The antics of &ldquo;jumping-beans&rdquo;
are due to the movements of tortricid caterpillars within the substance
of the seed.</p>

<p>The <i>Psychidae</i> are a small but widely-distributed family of moths
whose males have the head, densely clothed with rough hairs,
bearing complex, bipectinated feelers, but with the maxillae reduced
and useless. The larvae live in portable cases made of grass, pieces
of leaf or stick, with a silken lining, and these cases serve as cocoons
for the pupae which agree in structure with those of the Tortricidae.
But the most remarkable feature of the family is the extreme
degradation of the female, which, wingless, legless and without jaws
or feelers, never emerges from the cocoon.</p>

<p>The <i>Zygaenidae</i> (burnet moths) are a large family of day-flying
moths (fig. 21) adorned with brilliant metallic colours. The feelers
are long, stout in the middle and tapering, bearing numerous long
or short pectinations. The well-developed
maxillae have vestigial palps. The larvae&mdash;often
very conspicuously coloured&mdash;are remarkable
among the Tineides in having incomplete
circles of hooks on the prolegs, and they feed
exposed on the leaves of various plants. The
pupa, enclosed in a silken cocoon, has four or
five free segments. The <i>Limacodidae</i> are a small
family of brownish nocturnal moths, allied to
the Zygaenidae and agreeing with them in the
structure of the pupa. The larva in this family
also is an exposed feeder, but it is remarkable in form, being
flattened and slug-like, without prolegs and adorned with curious
spinous processes.</p>

<p>The <i>Sesiidae</i> are a large family of small, narrow-winged moths,
the sub-costal nervure of the hindwing being absent and the wings
being for the most part
destitute of scales (fig.
22). The maxillae are
developed but their palps
are vestigial, while the
terminal segment of the
labial palp is short and
pointed. Many of these
insects have their bodies
banded with black and
yellow; this in conjunction
with the transparent
wings makes some of
them like wasps or
hornets in appearance.
The larvae feed in the
woody stems of various
plants. The pupa, with
three or four free abdominal
segments, remains
within its cocoon, formed with chips of wood, until the time
for its final change draws near; then it works itself partly out of
the tree by means of the spines on its abdominal segments.</p>

<p>The <i>Nepticulidae</i> are the smallest of all the Lepidoptera, measuring
only 3-8 mm. across the outspread wings, which are all lanceolate
and pointed at the tip. The sucking portions of the maxillae are
vestigial, but the palps are long and jointed. The larvae, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>
thoracic limbs or prolegs, but sometimes with paired rudimentary
processes on some of the segments, mine in the leaves of plants.
The pupa, with four free abdominal segments in the female and five
in the male, rests in a cocoon usually outside the mine.</p>

<p>The <i>Adelidae</i> are a family of delicate, but larger, moths with very
long feelers (fig. 23) especially in the males. The larvae feed, when
young, in flowers; later, protected by a flat case, they devour leaves;
the pupa resembles that of the Nepticulidae
in structure. The female has an ovipositor
adapted for piercing plant tissues.</p>

<p>The <i>Tineidae</i> are a large and important
family of small moths (figs. 14, 24, 25) with
rough-haired heads, and with the maxillae
and their palps usually well developed. Many of the genera have
narrow pointed wings with degraded neuration. The larvae differ
in their habits, some&mdash;<i>Gracilaria</i> for example&mdash;mine in leaves, while
others, like the well-known caterpillars of the clothes moth (<i>Tinea</i>)
surround themselves with portable cases (fig. 14) formed by spinning
together their own excrement. The female pupa has three, the
male four free abdominal segments.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Plutellides.</i></p>

<p>This group includes a few large families of small moths that are
linked by their imaginal and larval structure to the Tineidae (in
which they have often been included) and by their pupal structure
to the higher groups that have yet to be considered. The moths
have labial palps with slender pointed terminal segments, and
narrow pointed wings, but the neuration (except in the Elachistidae)
is less degenerate than in most Tineidae. The hairy covering of the
head is smooth, and the maxillary palps are usually vestigial. The
egg is flat, and the larval prolegs have complete circles of hooklets.
The pupa is obtect with only two free abdominal segments (fifth
and sixth) in both sexes and does not move out of the cocoon.</p>

<p>Four families are included in this group. The <i>Plutellidae</i> (fig. 26)
have the maxillary palps developed, in some genera, as slender
threadlike appendages directed straight forward. The larvae do not
usually mine in leaves, but feed openly, keeping to the underside for
protection (<i>Plutella</i>),
or spinning by their
united labour a mass
of web over the food-plant
(<i>Hyponomeuta</i>).
In the other three
families the maxillary
palps are vestigial or
obsolete. The <i>Elachistidae</i>
have remarkably
narrow, pointed wings
and their larvae mine in leaves or form portable cases and feed
among seeds. In the <i>Oecophoridae</i> (fig. 27) the sub-costal nervure
of the hindwing is free and distinct throughout its length, and the
larvae usually feed among spun leaves or seeds, or in decayed
wood. The <i>Gelechiidae</i> are a large family with similar larval habits;
the moths are distinguished by the sinuate termen of the hindwing
and the connexion of its sub-costal nervure with the discoidal
areolet.</p>

<p>This group includes a number of moths of delicate build with
elongate legs, the maxillae and their palps being usually well
developed. The
forewings have
two anal nervures,
the hindwings
three (fig.
30, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>); in the
hindwing the sub-costal
nervure
bends towards
and often connects
with the
radial, and the
frenulum is
usually present.
The egg is flat.
The larva has complete circles of hooklets on its five pairs of prolegs,
and the pupa (usually completely obtect) does not move at all from
its cocoon. This group includes the only Lepidoptera that have
aquatic larvae.</p>

<p>Of the families comprised in this division three deserve special
mention. The <i>Pterophoridae</i> (plume moths, fig. 28) usually have
the wings deeply cleft&mdash;a single cleft in the forewing and two in the
hindwing. The hairy larvae feed openly on leaves, while the soft
and hairy pupa remains attached to its cocoon by the cremaster,
although it is incompletely obtect and has three or four free abdominal
segments. The <i>Orneodidae</i> (multiplume moths) have all
the wings six-cleft. Our British species, <i>Orneodes hexadactyla</i> (fig. 29),
is an exquisite little insect, whose larva feeds on the blossoms of
honeysuckle. The pupa is completely obtect, with only two free
abdominal segments. The <i>Pyralidae</i> (figs. 13, 30), a large family
with numerous divisions, have entire wings, and their pupae are
obtect. The caterpillars feed in some kind of shelter, some spinning
a loose case among the leaves of their food-plant, others burrowing
into dry vegetable substances or eating the waxen cells of bees.
Several species of this group, such as the Mediterranean flour moth,
<i>Ephestia kühniella</i> (fig. 30), become serious pests in storehouses and
granaries, their larvae devouring flour and similar food-stuffs.</p>

<p>In this group may be included a number of families of moths
with the second median nervure of the forewing arising close to the
third. This feature of neuration characterizes also the Jugatae
(see fig. 6), Tineides, Plutellides and Pyralides. But the Noctuides
differ from these groups in having only two anal nervures in the
hindwing. The maxillary palps are absent or vestigial, and a frenulum
is usually present on the hindwing. The larva has usually ten
prolegs, whose hooklets are arranged only along the inner edge,
while the immobile pupa is always obtect with only two free abdominal
segments (the fifth and sixth). The Lasiocampidae and
their allies have flat eggs, but in the Noctuidae, Arctiidae and their
allies the egg is upright.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 310px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>The <i>Lasiocampidae</i>, together with a few small families, differ from
the majority of this group in wanting a frenulum. The maxillae of
the Lasiocampidae are so reduced that no food is taken in the
imaginal state, and in correlation with this condition the feelers of
the male are strongly (those of the female more feebly) bipectinated.
The moths are stout, hairy insects, usually brown or yellow in the
pattern of their wings. The caterpillars are densely hairy and
many species hibernate in the larval stage. The pupa is enclosed in
a hard, dense cocoon, whence the name &ldquo;eggars&rdquo; is often applied
to the family, which has a wide distribution, but is absent from
New Zealand. The <i>Drepanulidae</i> are an allied family, in which the
frenulum is usually present, while
the hindmost pair of larval prolegs
are absent, their segment
being prolonged into a pointed
process which is raised up when
the caterpillar is at rest. The
hook-tip moths represent this
family in the British fauna.</p>

<p>The <i>Lymantriidae</i> resemble the
Lasiocampidae in their hairy
bodies ana vestigial maxillae, but
the frenulum is usually present
on the hindwing and the feelers
are bipectinate only in the males.
Some females of this family&mdash;the
vapourer moths (<i>Orgyia</i> and allies,
fig. 17), for example&mdash;are degenerate creatures with vestigial wings.
The larvae (fig. 15) are very hairy, and often carry dense tufts on
some of their segments; hence the name of &ldquo;tussocks&rdquo; frequently
applied to them. The pupae are also often hairy (fig. 16)&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span>
exceptional condition&mdash;and are protected by a cocoon of silk mixed
with some of the larval hairs, while the female sheds some hairs
from her own abdomen to cover the eggs. The family is widely
distributed, its headquarters being the eastern tropics. To that
part of the world is restricted the allied family of the <i>Hypsidae</i>,
distinguished from the &ldquo;tussocks&rdquo; by the slender upturned terminal
segment of the labial palps and by the development of the maxillae.</p>

<p>The <i>Noctuidae</i> are the largest and most dominant family of the
Lepidoptera, comprising some 10,000 known species. They are
mostly moths of dull coloration, flying at dusk or by night. The
maxillae are well developed, the hindwing has a frenulum, and its
sub-costal nervure
touches the radial
near the base. The
larvae of the Noctuidae
(fig. 34, <i>c</i>) are
rarely hairy and the
pupa (fig. 34, <i>d</i>)
usually rests in an
earthen cell, being
often the wintering
stage for the species;
sometimes the pupa
is enclosed in a loose
cocoon of silk and
leaves. In some
Noctuidae (fig. 32)
the hindwings are
brightly coloured, but these are concealed beneath the dull, inconspicuous
forewings when the insect rests (fig. 34, <i>f</i>). Nearly
allied to the Noctuidae, but very different in appearance, are the
gaily-coloured <i>Agaristidae</i>, a family of day-flying moths (figs. 35, 36),
confined to the warmer regions of the globe and distinguished by
their thickened feelers, those of the Noctuids being thread-like or
slightly pectinate.</p>

<p>The <i>Arctiidae</i> (tiger moths, footmen, &amp;c.) are allied to the Noctuidae,
but their wing-neuration is more specialized, the sub-costal
nervure of the hindwing being confluent with the radial for the basal
part of its course. These moths (fig. 37) have gaily coloured wings,
and the caterpillars are often densely covered with long smooth
hairs. The pupae are enclosed in silken cocoons (fig. 38). The
highest specialization of structure in this group of the Lepidoptera
is reached by the <i>Syntomidae</i>, a family nearly allied to the Arctiidae,
but with the sub-costal nervure in the hindwing absent. The
Syntomidae have elongate narrow forewings and short hindwings,
usually dark in colour with clear spots and dashes destitute of
scales (fig. 40). The body, on the other hand, is often brilliantly
adorned. The family, abundant in the tropics of the Old World,
has only two European species.</p>

the discocellular nervure midway between the first and third medians
(see fig. 5). These neurational characters may appear somewhat
insignificant, but such slight though constant distinctions in
structures of no adaptational value may be safely regarded as
truly significant of relationship. Several of the families in this
group have lost the frenulum. In larval and pupal characters the
Sphingides generally resemble the Noctuides, but in some families
there is a reduction in the number of the larval prolegs. The egg
is spherical or flat, upright only in the Notodontidae.</p>

<p>The Notodontidae are stout, hairy moths (figs. 5, 41, 42 <i>a</i>) with
maxillae and frenulum developed. In the larva the prolegs on the
hindmost segment are sometimes modified into pointed outgrowths
which are carried erect when the caterpillar moves about. From
these structures whip-like, coloured processes are protruded by the
caterpillar (fig. 42 <i>b</i>) of the puss moth (<i>Cerura</i>) when alarmed;
these processes are believed to help in &ldquo;terrifying&rdquo; the caterpillar&rsquo;s
enemies. Allied to the Notodontidae are the <i>Cymatophoridae</i>&mdash;a
family of moths agreeing with the Noctuidae in appearance and
habits&mdash;and the large and important family of the <i>Geometridae</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>
The moths (fig. 43) of this family are distinguished from the Notodontidae
by their delicate build and elongate feet, the caterpillars
(fig. 43, <i>c</i>) by the absence or vestigial condition of the three anterior
pairs of prolegs. The two hinder pairs of prolegs are therefore alone
functional and the larva progresses by &ldquo;looping,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> bending the
body so as to bring these prolegs close up to the thoracic legs, and
then, taking a fresh grip on the twig whereon it walks, stretching
the body straight out again. Many of these larvae have a striking
resemblance both in form and colour to the twigs of their food-plant.
In some of the species the female has the wings reduced to
useless vestiges. The family is world-wide in its range. The tropical
<i>Uraniidae</i> are large handsome moths (figs. 44, 45), often with exquisite
wing-patterns, allied to the Geometridae, but distinguished
by the absence of a frenulum in the moth and the presence of the
normal ten prolegs in the larva.</p>

<p>The <i>Sphingidae</i> (hawk moths) are insects often of large size
(figs. 46<i>a</i>, 47), with spindle-shaped feelers, elongate and powerful forewings
and the maxillae very well developed. The hindwing carries
a frenulum and has
its sub-costal nervure
connected with
the radial by a short
bar. The caterpillars
have the full
number of prolegs,
and, in many genera,
carry a prominent
dorsal horn on the
eighth abdominal
segment (fig. 46<i>b</i>).
The pupa lies in an
earthen cell. On
account of their
powerful flight the
moths of this family
have a wide range;
certain species&mdash;like
<i>Acherontia atropos</i>
and <i>Protoparce convolvuli</i>&mdash;migrate into the British Islands in
numbers almost every summer.</p>

<p>A group of families in which the first maxillae are vestigial, the
feelers bipectinate and the pupa enclosed in a dense silken cocoon,
have been regarded as
the most highly specialized
of all the moths,
though according to
other views the whole
series of the Lepidoptera
culminates in the Syntomidae.
Of these cocoon-spinning
families may
be specially mentioned
the <i>Eupterotidae</i>, large
brown or yellow moths
inhabiting tropical Asia
and Africa, and represented
in Europe only
by the &ldquo;processionary
moth&rdquo; (<i>Cnethocampa
processionea</i>). In this
family the frenulum is present, and the larvae are protected
with tufts of long hair. The <i>Bombycidae</i> have no frenulum, and
the larvae are smooth, with some of the segments humped and
the eighth abdominal often carrying a dorsal spine. The family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>475</span>
is tropical in its distribution, but the common silkworm (<i>Bombyx
mori</i>, fig. 48) has become acclimatized in southern Europe and is
the source of most of the silk used in manufacture and art. Of
commercial value also is the silk spun by the great moths of the
family <i>Saturniidae</i>, well represented in warm countries and contributing
a single species (<i>Saturnia pavonia-minor</i>) to the British
fauna. These moths (fig. 49) have but a single anal nervure in the
hindwing and only three radial nervures in the forewing. The
wing-patterns are handsome and striking; usually an unsealed
&ldquo;eyespot&rdquo; is conspicuous at the end of each discoidal areolet. The
caterpillars are protected by remarkable spine-bearing tubercles
(fig. 10, B).</p>

<p>This group stands at the base of the series of families that are
usually distinguished as &ldquo;butterflies.&rdquo; The feelers are recurved at
the tip, and thickened just before the extremity. The forewing
has the full number of radial
nervures, distinct and evenly spaced,
and two anal nervures; the frenulum
is usually absent. The larvae
(fig. 51) have prolegs with complete
circles of hooklets, and often feed
in concealed situations, while the
pupa is protected by a light cocoon.
The affinities of this group are
clearly not with the higher groups
of moths just described, but with
some of the lower families. According
to Meyrick they are most closely
related to the Pyralidae, but Hampson and most other students
would derive them (through the Castniidae) from a primitive Tineoid
stock allied to the Cossidae and Zygaenidae.</p>

<p>Three families are included in the section. The North American
<i>Megathymidae</i> and the Australian <i>Euschemonidae</i> have a frenulum
and are usually reckoned among the &ldquo;moths.&rdquo; The <i>Hesperiidae</i>
in which the frenulum is wanting form the large family of the
skipper butterflies, represented in our own fauna by several species.
They are insects with broad head&mdash;the feelers being widely separated&mdash;usually
brown or grey wings (fig. 50) and a peculiar jerky flight.
The family has an extensive range but is unknown in Greenland,
New Zealand, and in many oceanic
islands.</p>

<p>This group comprises the typical
butterflies which are much more
highly specialized than the Grypocera,
and may be readily distinguished
by the knobbed or clubbed
feelers and by the absence of a
frenulum. Two or more of the
radial nervures in the forewing arise
from a common stalk or are suppressed.
The egg is &ldquo;upright.&rdquo; The
larvae have hooklets only on the
inner edges of the prolegs. The pupa
is very highly modified, only two free
abdominal segments are ever recognizable,
and in some genera even
these have become consolidated. The
cocoon is reduced to a pad of silk,
to which the pupa is attached, suspended
by the cremastral hooks; in
some families there is also a silken
girdle around the waist-region. In
correlation with the exposed condition
of the pupa, we find the
presence of a specially developed
&ldquo;head-piece&rdquo; or &ldquo;nose-horn&rdquo; to
protect the head-region of the contained
imago. Their bright colours
and conspicuous flight in the sunshine has made the Rhopalocera
the most admired of all insects by the casual observer.</p>

<p>A modification that has taken place in
several families of butterflies is the reduction
of the first pair of legs. H. W.
Bates arranged the families in a series
depending on this character, but neurational
and pupal features must be taken
into account as well, and the sequence
followed here is modified from that proposed
by A. R. Grote and J. W. Tutt.</p>

<p>The <i>Lycaenidae</i> are a large family including
the small butterflies (figs. 52, 53,
54) popularly known as blues, coppers
and hairstreaks. The forelegs in the
female are normal, but in the male the
tarsal segments are shortened and the claws sometimes are absent.
The forewing has only three or four radial nervures (fig. 55), the last two
of which arise from a common stalk; the feelers are inserted close
together on the head. The larva is short and hairy, somewhat like
a woodlouse in shape, the broad sides concealing the legs and prolegs,
while the pupa, which is also hairy or bristly, is attached by the
cremaster to a silken pad and cinctured with a silken thread. The
upper surfaces of the wings of these insects are usually of a bright
metallic hue&mdash;blue or coppery&mdash;while beneath there are often
numerous dark centred &ldquo;eye-spots.&rdquo; The family is widely distributed.
Nearly related are the <i>Lemoniidae</i>, a family abundantly
represented in the Neotropical Region, but scarce in the Old World
and having only a single European species (<i>Nemeobius lucinia</i>)
which occurs also in England. In the Lemoniidae (figs. 56, 57) the
forelegs of the male are reduced and useless for walking. The
<i>Libytheidae</i> may be recognized by the elongate snout-like palps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476"></a>476</span>
the five-branched radial nervure of the forewing, the cylindrical
hairy larva, and the pupa attached only by the cremaster.</p>

<p>The <i>Papilionidae</i> are large butterflies with ample wings, and all
six legs fully developed in both sexes. The forewing has five radial
and two anal nervures, the second of the latter being free from the
first and running to the dorsum of the wing, while the hindwing has
but a single anal, and is frequently prolonged into a &ldquo;tail&rdquo; at the
third median nervure (fig. 58). The larva is cylindrical, never
hairy but often tuberculate and provided with a dorsal retractile
tentacle (osmaterium) on the prothorax. The pupa, which has a
double &ldquo;nose-horn,&rdquo; is attached by the cremaster and a waist-girdle
to the food-plant in the Papilioninae (fig. 58), but lies in a web
on the ground among the Parnasiinae (figs. 59, 60). The latter sub-family
includes the well-known Apollo butterflies of the Alps.
The former is represented in the British fauna by the East Anglian
swallow-tail (<i>Papilio machaon</i>), and is very abundant in the warmer
regions of the world, including
some of the most
magnificent and brilliant
of insects.</p>

<p>Agreeing with the
Papilionidae in the six
perfect legs of both sexes
and the cincture-support
of the pupa we find the
<i>Pieridae</i>&mdash;the family of
the white and yellow
butterflies (figs. 61, 62)&mdash;represented
by ten species
in the British fauna and
very widely spread over
the earth&rsquo;s surface. In
the <i>Pieridae</i> there are two anal nervures in the hindwing, while the
second anal nervure in the forewing runs into the first; the larva
is cylindrical and hairy without an osmaterium. The pupa has a
single &ldquo;nose-horn,&rdquo; and
in the more highly organized
genera there is no
mobility whatever between
its abdominal segments.
The wintering
pupae of the common

<p>The <i>Nymphalidae</i> are
by far the largest and
most dominant family
of butterflies. In both sexes the forelegs are useless for walking
(fig. 63), the tarsal segments being absent and the short shins
clothed with long hairs, whence the name of brush-footed butterflies
is often applied to the family. The neuration of the wings resembles
that found among the Pieridae, but in the Nymphalidae the pupa,
which has a double nose-horn (fig. 65)&mdash;as in <i>Papilio</i>&mdash;is suspended
from the cremaster only, no girdling thread being present, or it lies
simply on the ground. The egg is elongate and sub-conical in form
and ornamented with numerous ribs, while the larva is usually
protected by numerous spines (fig. 64) arising from the segmental
tubercles. To this family belong our common gaily-coloured
butterflies&mdash;the tortoiseshells, peacock (fig. 65), admirals, fritillaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>
and emperors. In most cases the bright colouring is confined to the
upper surface of the wings, the under-side being mottled and often
inconspicuous. Most members of the group Vanessidi&mdash;the peacock
and tortoiseshells (<i>Vanessa</i>) and the red admiral (<i>Pyrameis</i>) for
example&mdash;hibernate in the imaginal state. This large family is
divided into several sub-families whose characters may be briefly
given, as they are considered to be distinct families by many entomologists.
The <i>Danainae</i> (or <i>Euploeinae</i>, fig. 66) have the anal nervures
of the forewing arising from a common stalk, the discoidal areolets in
both wings closed, and the front feet of the female thickened; their
larvae are smooth with fleshy processes. The danaine butterflies
range over all the warmer parts of the world, becoming most numerous
in the eastern tropics, where flourish the handsome purple
<i>Euploeae</i> whose males often have &ldquo;brands&rdquo; on the wings; these
insects are conspicuously marked and are believed to be distasteful
to birds and lizards. So are the South American <i>Ithomiinae</i>,
distinguished from the Danainae by the slender feet of the females;
the narrow winged, tawny <i>Acraeinae</i>, with simple anal nervures, thick
hairy palps and spiny larvae;
and the <i>Heliconiinae</i> whose palps
are compressed, scaly at the
sides and hairy in front. This
last named sub-family is confined
to the Neotropical Region,
while the Acraeinae are most
numerous in the Ethiopian. The
<i>Nymphalinae</i> include the British
vanessids (fig. 65), and a vast
assemblage of exotic genera
(figs. 68, 70), characterized by
the &ldquo;open&rdquo; discoidal areolets (fig. 67) owing to the absence of the
transverse &ldquo;disco-cellular&rdquo; nervules. In the <i>Morphinae</i>&mdash;including
some magnificent South American insects with deep or azure
blue wings, and a few rather dull-coloured Oriental genera&mdash;the
areolets are closed in the forewings and often in the hindwings.
The larvae of the Morphinae (fig. 71) are smooth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>
or hairy with a curiously forked tail-segment. A similar larva
characterizes the South American <i>Brassolinae</i> or owl-butterflies&mdash;robust
insects (figs. 72, 73) with the areolets closed in both wings,
which are adorned with large &ldquo;eye-spots&rdquo; beneath. The <i>Satyrinae</i>,
including our native browns and the Alpine <i>Erebiae</i>, resemble the
foregoing group in many respects of structure, but the sub-costal
nervure is greatly thickened at the base (fig. 74). This sub-family
is world-wide in its distribution. One genus (<i>Oeneis</i>, fig. 75) is found
in high northern latitudes, but reappears in South America. The
dark, spotted species of <i>Erebia</i> are familiar insects to travellers
among the Alps; yet butterflies nearly related to these Alpine
insects occur in Patagonia, in South Africa and in New Zealand.
Such facts of distribution clearly show that though the Nymphalidae
have attained a high degree of specialization among the Lepidoptera,
some of their genera have a history which goes back to a time when
the distribution of land and water on the earth&rsquo;s surface must have
been very different from what it is to-day.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The handsome Lepidoptera, with their interesting
and easily observed life-histories, have naturally attracted
many students, and the literature of the order is enormous. M.
Malpighi&rsquo;s treatise on the anatomy of the silkworm (<i>De Bombycibus</i>,
London, 1669) and P. Lyonnet&rsquo;s memoir on the Goat-caterpillar,
are among the earliest and most famous of entomological writings.
W. F. Kirby&rsquo;s <i>Handbook to the Order Lepidoptera</i> (5 vols., London,
1894-1897) should be consulted for references to the older systematic
writers such as Linnaeus, J. C. Fabricius, J. Hübner, P. Cramer,
E. Doubleday and W. C. Hewitson. Kirby&rsquo;s <i>Catalogues</i> are also
invaluable for the systematist. For the jaws of the Lepidoptera see
F. Darwin, <i>Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci.</i> xv. (1875); E. Burgess, <i>Amer.
Nat.</i> xiv. (1880); A. Walter, <i>Jen. Zeits. f. Naturw.</i> xviii. (1885);
W. Breitenbach, Ib. xv. (1882); V. L. Kellogg, <i>Amer. Nat.</i> xxix.
(1895). The last-named deals also with wing structure, which is
further described by A. Spuler, <i>Zeits. wiss. Zool.</i> liii. (1892) and
<i>Zool. Jahrb. Anat.</i> viii. (1895); A. R. Grote, <i>Mitt. aus dem Roemer-Museum</i>

England</i> (3 vols., Cambridge, Mass., 1888-1889); W. J. Holland,
<i>Butterfly Book</i> (New York, 1899). Works on the British Lepidoptera
are numerous, for example, those of H. T. Stainton (1851), C. G.
Barrett (1893-1907), E. Meyrick (1895), and J. W. Tutt (1899 and

from 180 onwards, and was six times chosen by the censors
<i>princeps senatus</i>. He died in 152. He distinguished himself in
the war with Antiochus III. of Syria, and against the Ligurians.
He made the Via Aemilia from Ariminum to Placentia, and led

Spain to conduct the Numantine war, he began against the will
of the senate to attack the Vaccaei. This enterprise was so
unsuccessful that he was deprived of his command in 136 and
condemned to pay a fine. He was among the greatest of the
earlier Roman orators, and Cicero praises him for having

<p>3. <span class="sc">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</span>, father of the triumvir. In
81 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he was praetor of Sicily, where he made himself detested
by oppression and extortion. In the civil wars he sided with
Sulla and bought much of the confiscated property of the Marian
partisans. Afterwards he became leader of the popular party,
and with the help of Pompey was elected consul for 78, in spite
of the opposition of Sulla. When the dictator died, Lepidus
tried in vain to prevent the burial of his body in the Campus
Martius, and to alter the constitution established by him. His
colleague Lutatius Catulus found a tribune to place his veto on
Lepidus&rsquo;s proposals; and the quarrel between the two parties
in the state became so acute that the senate made the consuls
swear not to take up arms. Lepidus was then ordered by the
senate to go to his province, Transalpine Gaul; but he stopped
in Etruria on his way from the city and began to levy an army.
He was declared a public enemy early in 77, and forthwith
marched against Rome. A battle took place in the Campus
Martius, Pompey and Catulus commanding the senatorial army,
and Lepidus was defeated. He sailed to Sardinia, in order to
put himself into connexion with Sertorius in Spain, but here also
suffered a repulse, and died shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>4. <span class="sc">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</span>, the triumvir. He joined the
party of Julius Caesar in the civil wars, and was by the dictator
thrice nominated <i>magister equitum</i> and raised to the consulship
in 46 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He was a man of great wealth and influence, and it was
probably more on this ground than on account of his ability
that Caesar raised him to such honours. In the beginning of
44 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he was sent to Gallia Narbonensis, but before he had left
the city with his army Caesar was murdered. Lepidus, as
commander of the only army near Rome, became a man of great
importance in the troubles which followed. Taking part with
Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony), he joined in the reconciliation
which the latter effected with the senatorial party, and afterwards
sided with him when open war broke out. Antony, after his
defeat at Mutina, joined Lepidus in Gaul, and in August 43
Octavian (afterwards the emperor Augustus), who had forced
the senate to make him consul, effected an arrangement with
Antony and Lepidus, and their triumvirate was organized at
Bononia. Antony and Octavian soon reduced Lepidus to an
inferior position. His province of Gaul and Spain was taken from
him; and, though he was included in the triumvirate when it
was renewed in 37, his power was only nominal. He made an
effort in the following year to regain some reality of power,
conquered part of Sicily, and claimed the whole island as his
province, but Octavian found means to sap the fidelity of his
soldiers, and he was obliged to supplicate for his life. He was
allowed to retain his fortune and the office of <i>pontifex maximus</i>
to which he had been appointed in 44, but had to retire into
private life. According to Suetonius (<i>Augustus</i>, 16) he died at
Circeii in the year 13.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE PLAY, PIERRE GUILLAUME FRÉDÉRIC<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> (1806-1882),
French engineer and economist, was born at La Rivière-Saint-Sauveur
(Calvados) on the 11th of April 1806, the son of a
custom-house official. He was educated at the École Polytechnique,
and from there passed into the State Department
of Mines. In 1834 he was appointed head of the permanent
committee of mining statistics, and in 1840 engineer-in-chief
and professor of metallurgy at the school of mines, where he
became inspector in 1848. For nearly a quarter of a century
Le Play spent his vacations travelling in the various countries
of Europe, and collected a vast quantity of material bearing
upon the social condition of the working classes. In 1855 he
published <i>Les Ouvriers européens</i>, which comprised a series of
thirty-six monographs on the budgets of typical families selected
from the most diverse industries. The Académie des Sciences
conferred on him the Montyon prize. Napoleon III., who held
him in high esteem, entrusted him with the organization of the
Exhibition of 1855, and appointed him counsellor of state,
commissioner general of the Exhibition of 1867, senator of the
empire and grand officer of the Legion of Honour. He died in
Paris on the 5th of April 1882.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1856 Le Play founded the <i>Société internationale des études
pratiques d&rsquo;Économie sociale</i>, which has devoted its energies principally
to forwarding social studies on the lines laid down by its founder.
The journal of the society, <i>La Réforme sociale</i>, founded in 1881, is
published fortnightly. Other works of Le Play are <i>La Réforme

<p><span class="bold">LEPROSY<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> (<i>Lepra Arabum</i>, <i>Elephantiasis Graecorum</i>, <i>Aussatz</i>,
<i>Spedalskhed</i>), the greatest disease of medieval Christendom,
identified, on the one hand, with a disease endemic from the
earliest historical times (1500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) in the delta and valley of the
Nile, and, on the other hand, with a disease now common in Asia,
Africa, South America, the West Indies, and certain isolated
localities of Europe. An authentic representation of the leprosy
of the middle ages exists in a picture at Munich by Holbein,
painted at Augsburg in 1516; St Elizabeth gives bread and wine
to a prostrate group of lepers, including a bearded man whose face
is covered with large round reddish knobs, an old woman whose
arm is covered with brown blotches, the leg swathed in bandages
through which matter oozes, the bare knee also marked with
discoloured spots, and on the head a white rag or plaster, and,
thirdly, a young man whose neck and face (especially round the
somewhat hairless eyebrows) are spotted with brown patches
of various size. It is conjectured by Virchow that the painter
had made studies of lepers from the leper-houses then existing
at Augsburg. These external characters of medieval leprosy
agree with the descriptions of it by the ancients, and with the
pictures of modern leprosy given by Danielssen and Boeck for
Norway, by various authors for sporadic European cases, by
Anderson for Malacca, by Carter for India, by Wolff for Madeira
and by Hillis for British Guiana. There has been some confusion
in the technical naming of the disease; it is called <i>Elephantiasis</i>
(<i>Leontiasis</i>, <i>Satyriasis</i>) by the Greek writers, and <i>Lepra</i> by the
Arabians.</p>

<p>Leprosy is now included among the parasitic diseases (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parasitic Diseases</a></span>). The cause is believed to be infection
by the bacillus leprae, a specific microbe discovered by Armauer
Hansen in 1871. It is worthy of note that tuberculosis is very
common among lepers, and especially attacks the serous membranes.
The essential character of leprosy is a great multiplication
of cells, resembling the &ldquo;granulation cells&rdquo; of lupus and
syphilis, in the tissues affected, which become infiltrated and
thickened, with degeneration and destruction of their normal
elements. The new cells vary in size from ordinary leucocytes
to giant cells three or four times larger. The bacilli are found in
these cells, sometimes in small numbers, sometimes in masses.
The structures most affected are the skin, nerves, mucous membranes
and lymphatic glands.</p>

<p>The symptoms arise from the anatomical changes indicated,
and they vary according to the parts attacked. Three types of
disease are usually described&mdash;(1) nodular, (2) smooth or anaesthetic,
(3) mixed. In the first the skin is chiefly affected, in the
second the nerves; the third combines the features of both.
It should be understood that this classification is purely a matter
of convenience, and is based on the relative prominence of
symptoms, which may be combined in all degrees. The incubation
period of leprosy&mdash;assuming it to be due to infection&mdash;is
unknown, but cases are on record which can only be explained
on the hypothesis that it may be many years. The invasion
is usually slow and intermittent. There are occasional feverish
attacks, with the usual constitutional disturbance and other slight
premonitory signs, such as changes in the colour of the skin and
in its sensibility. Sometimes, but rarely, the onset is acute and
the characteristic symptoms develop rapidly. These begin with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>480</span>
an eruption which differs markedly according to the type of
disease. In the nodular form dark red or coppery patches appear
on the face, backs of the hands, and feet or on the body; they
are generally symmetrical, and vary from the size of a shilling
upwards. They come with one of the feverish attacks and fade
away when it has gone, but only to return. After a time infiltration
and thickening of the skin become noticeable, and the
nodules appear. They are lumpy excrescences, at first pink but
changing to brown. Thickening of the skin of the face produces
a highly characteristic appearance, recalling the aspect of a lion.
The tissues of the eye undergo degenerative changes; the
mucous membrane of the nose and throat is thickened, impairing
the breathing and the voice; the eyebrows fall off; the ears and
nose become thickened and enlarged. As the disease progresses
the nodules tend to break down and ulcerate, leaving open sores.
The patient, whose condition is extremely wretched, gradually
becomes weaker, and eventually succumbs to exhaustion or is
carried off by some intercurrent disease, usually inflammation
of the kidneys or tuberculosis. A severe case may end fatally
in two years, but, as a rule, when patients are well cared for the
illness lasts several years. There is often temporary improvement,
but complete recovery from this form of leprosy rarely
or never occurs. The smooth type is less severe and more
chronic. The eruption consists of patches of dry, slightly discoloured
skin, not elevated above the surface. These patches
are the result of morbid changes affecting the cutaneous nerves,
and are accompanied by diminished sensibility over the areas of
skin affected. At the same time certain nerve trunks in the
arm and leg, and particularly the ulnar nerve, are found to be
thickened. In the further stages the symptoms are those of
increasing degeneration of the nerves. Bullae form on the skin,
and the discoloured patches become enlarged; sensation is lost,
muscular power diminished, with wasting, contraction of tendons,
and all the signs of impaired nutrition. The nails become hard
and clawed; perforating ulcers of the feet are common; portions
of the extremities, including whole fingers and toes, die and drop
off. Later, paralysis becomes more marked, affecting the
muscles of the face and limbs. The disease runs a very chronic
course, and may last twenty or thirty years. Recovery occasionally
occurs. In the mixed form, which is probably the most
common, the symptoms described are combined in varying
degrees. Leprosy may be mistaken for syphilis, tuberculosis,
ainhum (an obscure disease affecting negroes, in which the little
toe drops off), and several affections of the skin. Diagnosis is
established by the presence of the bacillus leprae in the nodules
or bullae, and by the signs of nerve degeneration exhibited in
the anaesthetic patches of skin and the thickened nerve trunks.</p>

<p>In former times leprosy was often confounded with other
skin diseases, especially psoriasis and leucoderma; the white
leprosy of the Old Testament was probably a form of the latter.
But there is no doubt that true leprosy has existed from time
immemorial. Prescriptions for treating it have been found in
Egypt, to which a date of about 4600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> is assigned. The disease
is described by Aristotle and by later Greek writers, but not
by Hippocrates, though leprosy derives its name from his &ldquo;lepra&rdquo;
or &ldquo;scaly&rdquo; disease, which was no doubt psoriasis. In ancient
times it was widely prevalent throughout Asia as well as in
Egypt, and among the Greeks and Romans. In the middle
ages it became extensively diffused in Europe, and in some
countries&mdash;France, England, Germany and Spain&mdash;every considerable
town had its leper-house, in which the patients were
segregated. The total number of such houses has been reckoned
at 19,000. The earliest one in England was established at
Canterbury in 1096, and the latest at Highgate in 1472. At one
time there were at least 95 religious hospitals for lepers in Great
Britain and 14 in Ireland (Sir James Simpson). During the 15th
century the disease underwent a remarkable diminution. It
practically disappeared in the civilized parts of Europe, and the
leper-houses were given up. It is a singular fact that this
diminution was coincident with the great extension of syphilis
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prostitution</a></span>). The general disappearance of leprosy
at this time is the more unintelligible because it did not take
effect everywhere. In Scotland the disease lingered until the
19th century, and in some other parts it has never died out at
all. At the present time it still exists in Norway, Iceland, along
the shores of the Baltic, in South Russia, Greece, Turkey, several
Mediterranean islands, the Riviera, Spain and Portugal. Isolated
cases occasionally occur elsewhere, but they are usually imported.
The Teutonic races seem to be especially free from the taint.
Leper asylums are maintained in Norway and at two or three
places in the Baltic, San Remo, Cyprus, Constantinople, Alicante
and Lisbon. Except in Spain, where some increase has taken
place, the disease is dying out. The number of lepers in Norway
was 3000 in 1856, but has now dwindled to a few hundreds.
They are no longer numerous in any part of Europe. On the
other hand, leprosy prevails extensively throughout Asia, from
the Mediterranean to Japan, and from Arabia to Siberia. It
is also found in nearly all parts of Africa, particularly on the
east and west coasts near the equator. In South Africa it has
greatly increased, and attacks the Dutch as well as natives.
Leper asylums have been established at Robben Island near
Cape Town, and in Tembuland. In Australia, where it was
introduced by Chinese, it has also spread to Europeans. In
New Zealand the Maoris are affected; but the amount of leprosy
is not large in either country. A much more remarkable case
is that of the Hawaiian Islands, where the disease is believed
to have been imported by Chinese. It was unknown before
1848, but in 1866 the number of lepers had risen to 230 and
in 1882 to 4000 (Liveing). All attempts to stop it by segregating
lepers in the settlement of Molokai appear to have been fruitless.
In the West Indies and on the American continent,
again, leprosy has a wide distribution. It is found in nearly all
parts of South and Central America, and in certain parts of
North America&mdash;namely, Louisiana, California (among Chinese),
Minnesota, Wisconsin and North and South Dakota (Norwegians),
New Brunswick (French Canadians).</p>

<p>It is difficult to find any explanation of the geographical
distribution and behaviour of leprosy. It seems to affect islands
and the sea-coast more than the interior, and to some extent
this gives colour to the old belief that it is caused or fostered
by a fish diet, which has been revived by Mr Jonathan Hutchinson,
but is not generally accepted. Leprosy is found in interiors
where fish is not an article of diet. Climate, again, has obviously
little, if any, influence. The theory of heredity is equally at
fault, whether it be applied to account for the spread of the
disease by transmission or for its disappearance by the elimination
of susceptible persons. The latter is the manner in which
heredity might be expected to act, if at all, for lepers are remarkably
sterile. But we see the disease persisting among
the Eastern races, who have been continuously exposed to its
selective influence from the earliest times, while it has disappeared
among the Europeans, who were affected very much later.
The opposite theory of hereditary transmission from parents to
offspring is also at variance with many observed facts. Leprosy
is very rarely congenital, and no cases have occurred among the
descendants to the third generation of 160 Norwegian lepers
settled in the United States. Again, if hereditary transmission
were an effective influence, the disease could hardly have died
down so rapidly as it did in Europe in the 15th century. Then
we have the theory of contagion. There is no doubt that human
beings are inoculable with leprosy, and that the disease may
be communicated by close contact. Cases have been recorded
which prove it conclusively; for instance, that of a man who
had never been out of the British islands, but developed leprosy
after sharing for a time the bed and clothes of his brother, who
had contracted the disease in the West Indies. Some of the
facts noted, such as the extensive dissemination of the disease
in Europe during the middle ages, and its subsequent rapid
decline, suggest the existence of some unknown epidemic factor.
Poverty and insanitation are said to go with the prevalence of
leprosy, but they go with every malady, and there is nothing
to show that they have any special influence. Vaccination has
been blamed for spreading it, and a few cases of communication
by arm-to-arm inoculation are recorded. The influence of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>481</span>
factor, however, can only be trifling. Vaccination is a new thing,
leprosy a very old one; where there is most vaccination there
is no leprosy, and where there is most leprosy there is little or
no vaccination. In India 78% of the lepers are unvaccinated,
and in Canton since vaccination was introduced leprosy has
declined (Cantlie). On the whole we must conclude that there
is still much to be learnt about the conditions which govern
the prevalence of leprosy.</p>

<p>With regard to prevention, the isolation of patients is obviously
desirable, especially in the later stages, when open sores may
disseminate the bacilli; but complete segregation, which has
been urged, is regarded as impracticable by those who have
had most experience in leprous districts. Scrupulous cleanliness
should be exercised by persons attending on lepers or brought
into close contact with them. In treatment the most essential
thing is general care of the health, with good food and clothing.
The tendency of modern therapeutics to attach increasing
importance to nutrition in various morbid states, and notably
in diseases of degeneration, such as tuberculosis and affections
of the nervous system, is borne out by experience in leprosy,
which has affinities to both; and this suggests the application
to it of modern methods for improving local as well as general
nutrition by physical means. A large number of internal remedies
have been tried with varying results; those most recommended
are chaulmoogra oil, arsenic, salicylate of soda, salol and chlorate
of potash. Vergueira uses Collargol intravenously and subcutaneously,
and states that in all the cases treated there was
marked improvement, and hair that had been lost grew again.
Calmette&rsquo;s Anterenene injected subcutaneously has been followed
by good results. Deycke together with R. Bey isolated from
a non-ulcerated leprous nodule a streptothrix which they call S.
leproides. Its relation to the bacillus is uncertain. They found
that injections of this organism had marked curative effects,
due to a neutral fat which they named &ldquo;Nastin.&rdquo; Injections
of Nastin together with Benzoyl Chloride directly act on the
lepra bacilli. Some cases were unaffected by this treatment,
but with others the effect was marvellous. Dr W. A. Pusey of
Chicago uses applications of carbon dioxide snow with good effect.
In the later stages of the disease there is a wide field for surgery,
which is able to give much relief to sufferers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEPSIUS, KARL RICHARD<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> (1810-1884), German Egyptologist,
was born at Naumburg-am-Saale on the 23rd of December
1810, and in 1823 was sent to the &ldquo;Schulpforta&rdquo; school near
Naumburg, where he came under the influence of Professor
Lange. In 1829 he entered the university of Leipzig, and one
year later that of Göttingen, where, under the influence of
Otfried Müller, he finally decided to devote himself to the
archaeological side of philology. From Göttingen he proceeded
to Berlin, where he graduated in 1833 as doctor with the thesis
<i>De tabulis Eugubinis</i>. In the same year he proceeded to study
in Paris, and was commissioned by the duc de Luynes to collect
material from the Greek and Latin writers for his work on the
weapons of the ancients. In 1834 he took the Volney prize
with his <i>Paläographie als Mittel der Sprachforschung</i>. Befriended
by Bunsen and Humboldt, Lepsius threw himself with great
ardour into Egyptological studies, which, since the death of
Champollion in 1832, had attracted no scholar of eminence and
weight. Here Lepsius found an ample field for his powers. After
four years spent in visiting the Egyptian collections of Italy,
Holland and England, he returned to Germany, where Humboldt
and Bunsen united their influence to make his projected visit
to Egypt a scientific expedition with royal support. For three
years Lepsius and his party explored the whole of the region in
which monuments of ancient Egyptian and Ethiopian occupation
are found, from the Sudan above Khartum to the Syrian coast.
At the end of 1845 they returned home, and the results of the
expedition, consisting of casts, drawings and squeezes of inscriptions
and scenes, maps and plans collected with the utmost
thoroughness, as well as antiquities and papyri, far surpassed
expectations. In 1846 he married Elisabeth Klein, and his
appointment to a professorship in Berlin University in the
following August afforded him the leisure necessary for the
completion of his work. In 1859 the twelve volumes of his
vast <i>Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien</i> were finished,
supplemented later by a text prepared from the note-books of
the expedition; they comprise its entire archaeological, palaeographical
and historical results. In 1866 Lepsius again went to
Egypt, and discovered the famous Decree of Tanis or Table of
Canopus, an inscription of the same character as the Rosetta
Stone, in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek. In 1873 he was
appointed keeper of the Royal Library, Berlin, which, like the
Berlin Museum, owes much to his care. About ten years later
he was appointed Geheimer Oberregierungsrath. He died at
Berlin on the 10th of July 1884. Besides the colossal <i>Denkmäler</i>
and other publications of texts such as the <i>Todtenbuch der
Ägypter</i> (<i>Book of the Dead</i>, 1842) his other works, amongst
which may be specially named his <i>Königsbuch der Ägypter</i>
(1858) and <i>Chronologie der Ägypter</i> (1849), are characterized
by a quality of permanence that is very remarkable in a subject
of such rapid development as Egyptology. In spite of his
scientific training in philology Lepsius left behind few translations
of inscriptions or discussions of the meanings of words:
by preference he attacked historical and archaeological problems
connected with the ancient texts, the alphabet, the metrology,
the names of metals and minerals, the chronology, the royal
names. On the other hand one of his latest works, the <i>Nubische
Grammatik</i> (1880), is an elaborate grammar of the then little-known
Nubian language, preceded by a linguistic sketch of the
African continent. Throughout his life he profited by the gift
of attaching to himself the right men, whether as patrons or,
like Weidenbach and Stern, as assistants. Lepsius was a fine
specimen of the best type of German scholar.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEPTINES,<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> an Athenian orator, known as the proposer of a
law that no Athenian, whether citizen or resident alien (with
the sole exception of the descendants of Harmodius and Aristogeiton),
should be exempt from the public charges (<span class="grk" title="leitourgiai">&#955;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>)
for the state festivals. The object was to provide funds for the
festivals and public spectacles at a time when both the treasury
and the citizens generally were short of money. It was further
asserted that many of the recipients of immunity were really
unworthy of it. Against this law Demosthenes delivered
(354 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) his well-known speech <i>Against Leptines</i> in support of
the proposal of Ctesippus that all the cases of immunity should
be carefully investigated. Great stress is laid on the reputation
for ingratitude and breach of faith which the abolition of immunities
would bring upon the state. Besides, the law itself
had been passed unconstitutionally, for an existing law confirmed
these privileges, and by the constitution of Solon no law could
be enacted until any existing law which it contravened had been
repealed. The law was probably condemned. Nothing further
is known of Leptines.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEPTIS,<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> the name of two towns in ancient Africa. The
first, Leptis Magna (<span class="grk" title="Leptimagna">&#923;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#956;&#945;&#947;&#957;&#945;</span>), the modern Lebda, was in
Tripolitana between Tripolis and Mesrata at the mouth of the
Cinyps; the second, Leptis Parva (<span class="grk" title="Leptis hê mikra">&#923;&#941;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#7969; &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#940;</span>), known also
as Leptiminus or Leptis minor, the modern Lamta, was a
small harbour of Byzacena between Ruspina (Monastir) and
Thapsus (Dimas).</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Leptis Magna</span> was one of the oldest and most flourishing
of the Phoenician emporia established on the coasts of the
greater Syrtis, the chief commercial entrepot for the interior of the
African continent. It was founded by the Sidonians (Sallust,
<i>Jug.</i> 78) who were joined later by people of Tyre (Pliny, <i>Hist.
Nat.</i> v. 17). Herodotus enlarges on the fertility of its territory
(iv. 175, v. 42). It was tributary to Carthage to which it paid a
contribution of a talent a day (Livy xxxiv. 62). After the Second
Punic War Massinissa made himself master of it (Sallust, <i>Jug.</i>
78; Livy xxxiv. 62; Appian viii. 106). During the Jugurthine
War it appealed for protection to Rome (Sallust, <i>Jug.</i> 78).
Though captured and plundered by Juba, it maintained its
allegiance to Rome, supported the senatorial cause, received
Cato the younger with the remains of the Pompeian forces after
Pharsalus 48 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> After his victory Julius Caesar imposed upon
it an annual contribution of 300,000 measures of oil. Nevertheless,
it preserved its position as a free city governed by its own
magistrates (<i>C.I.L.</i> viii. 7). It received the title of <i>municipium</i>
(<i>C.I.L.</i> viii. 8), and was subsequently made a <i>colonia</i>
by Trajan (<i>C.I.L.</i> viii. 10). Septimius Severus, who was
born there, beautified the place and conferred upon it the <i>Ius
Italicum</i>. Leptis Magna was the limit of the Roman state, the
last station of the <i>limes Tripolitanus</i>; hence, especially during
the last centuries of the Empire, it suffered much from the
Nomads of the desert, the Garamantes, the Austuriani and the
Levathae (Ammian. Marc. xxviii. 6; Procop. <i>De Aedif.</i> vi. 4).
Its commerce declined and its harbour silted up. Justinian
made a vain attempt to rebuild it (Procop. <i>ibid.</i>; Ch. Diehl,
<i>L&rsquo;Afrique byzantine</i>, p. 388). It was the seat of a bishopric,
but no mention is made of its bishops after 462.</p>

<p>Leptis Magna had a citadel which protected the commercial
city which was generally called Neapolis, the situation of which
may be compared with that of Carthage at the foot of Byrsa.
Its ruins are still imposing; remains of ramparts and docks,
a theatre, a circus and various buildings of the Roman period still
exist. Inscriptions show that the current pronunciation of the
name was Lepcis, Lepcitana, instead of Leptis, Leptitana
(Tissot, <i>Géogr. comp. de la prov. d&rsquo;Afrique</i>, ii. 219; Clermont-Ganneau,
<i>Recueil d&rsquo;archéologie orientale</i>, vi. 41; <i>Comptes
rendus de l&rsquo;Acad. des Inscr. et B.-Lettres</i>, 1903, p. 333;
Cagnat, <i>C.R. Acad.</i>, 1905, p. 531). The coins of Leptis Magna,
like the majority of the emporia in the neighbourhood, present a
series from the Punic period. They are of bronze with the legend
<span title="lepqi">&#1500;&#1508;&#1511;&#1497;</span> (<i>Lepqi</i>). They have on one side the head of Bacchus,
Hercules or Cybele, and on the other various emblems of these
deities. From the Roman period we have also coins bearing the
heads of Augustus, Livia and Tiberius, which still have the name
of the town in Neo-Punic script (Lud. Müller, <i>Numism. de
l&rsquo;anc. Afrique</i>, ii. 3).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The ruins of Leptis Magna have been visited by numerous travellers
since the time of Frederick William and Henry William Beechey
(<i>Travels</i>, pp. 51 and 74) and Heinrich Barth (<i>Wanderungen</i>, pp.
306, 360); they are described by Ch. Tissot (<i>Géogr. comp.</i> ii. 219
et seq.); Cl. Perroud, <i>De Syrticis emporiis</i>, p. 33 (Paris, 1881,
in 8°); see also a description in the New York journal, <i>The Nation</i>
(1877), vol. xxvii. No. 683. M. Méhier de Mathuisieulx explored
the site afresh in 1901; his account is inserted in the <i>Nouvelles
Archives des missions</i>, x. 245-277; cf. vol. xii. See also J. Toutain,
&ldquo;Le Limes Tripolitanus en Tripolitaine,&rdquo; in the <i>Bulletin archéologique
áu comité des travaux historiques</i> (1905).</p>
</div>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Leptis Parva</span> (Lamta), 7½ m. from Monastir, which is
often confused by modern writers with Leptis Magna in their
interpretations of ancient texts (Tissot, <i>Géogr. comp.</i> ii. 169),
was, according to the <i>Tabula Peutingeriana</i>, 18 m. south of
Hadrumetum. Evidently Phoenician in origin like Leptis
Magna, it was in the Punic period of comparatively slight
importance. Nevertheless, it had fortifications, and the French
engineer, A. Daux, has discovered a probable line of ramparts.
Like its neighbour Hadrumetum, Leptis Parva declared for
Rome after the last Punic War. Also after the fall of Carthage
in 146 it preserved its autonomy and was declared a <i>civitas
libera et immunis</i> (Appian, <i>Punica</i>, 94; <i>C.I.L.</i> i. 200; <i>De
bell. Afric.</i> c. xii.). Julius Caesar made it the base of his operations
before the battle of Thapsus in 46 (Ch. Tissot, <i>Géogr.
comp.</i> ii. 728). Under the Empire Leptis Parva became
extremely prosperous; its bishops appeared in the African
councils from 258 onwards. In Justinian&rsquo;s reorganization of
Africa we find that Leptis Parva was with Capsa one of the two
residences of the <i>Dux Byzacenae</i> (Tissot, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 171). The
town had coins under Augustus and Tiberius. On the obverse
is the imperial effigy with a Latin legend, and on the reverse
the Greek legend <span class="grk" title="LEPTIS">&#923;&#917;&#928;&#932;&#921;C</span> with the bust of Mercury (Lud.
Müller, <i>Numism. de l&rsquo;anc. Afrique</i>, ii. 49). The ruins extend
along the sea-coast to the north-west of Lemta; the remains of
docks, the amphitheatre and the acropolis can be distinguished;
a Christian cemetery has furnished tombs adorned with curious
mosaics.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE PUY<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Le Puy en Velay</span>, a town of south-eastern
France, capital of the department of Haute-Loire, 90 m. S.W.
of Lyons on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) town, 17,291;
commune, 21,420. Le Puy rises in the form of an amphitheatre
from a height of 2050 ft. above sea-level upon Mont Anis, a
hill that divides the left bank of the Dolézon from the right bank
of the Borne (a rapid stream joining the Loire 3 m. below).
From the new town, which lies east and west in the valley of
the Dolézon, the traveller ascends the old feudal and ecclesiastical
town through narrow steep streets, paved with pebbles of lava,
to the cathedral commanded by the fantastic pinnacle of Mont
Corneille. Mont Corneille, which is 433 ft. above the Place de
Breuil (in the lower town), is a steep rock of volcanic breccia,
surmounted by an iron statue of the Virgin (53 ft. high) cast,
after a model by Bonassieux, out of guns taken at Sebastopol.
Another statue, that of Msgr de Morlhon, bishop of Le Puy,
also sculptured by Bonassieux, faces that of the Virgin. From
the platform of Mont Corneille a magnificent panoramic view
is obtained of the town and of the volcanic mountains, which
make this region one of the most interesting parts of France.</p>

<p>The Romanesque cathedral (Notre-Dame), dating chiefly
from the first half of the 12th century, has a particoloured
façade of white sandstone and black volcanic breccia, which
is reached by a flight of sixty steps, and consists of three tiers,
the lowest composed of three high arcades opening into the
porch, which extends beneath the first bays of the nave; above
are three windows lighting the nave; and these in turn are
surmounted by three gables, two of which, those to the right
and the left, are of open work. The staircase continues within
the porch, where it divides, leading on the left to the cloister,
on the right into the church. The doorway of the south transept
is sheltered by a fine Romanesque porch. The isolated bell-tower
(184 ft.), which rises behind the choir in seven storeys, is one
of the most beautiful examples of the Romanesque transition
period. The bays of the nave are covered in by octagonal
cupolas, the central cupola forming a lantern. The choir and
transepts are barrel-vaulted. Much veneration is paid to a
small image of the Virgin on the high altar, a modern copy
of the medieval image destroyed at the Revolution. The cloister,
to the north of the choir, is striking, owing to its variously-coloured
materials and elegant shafts. Viollet-le-Duc considered
one of its galleries to belong to the oldest known type of cathedral
cloister (8th or 9th century). Connected with the cloister are
remains of fortifications of the 13th century, by which it was
separated from the rest of the city. Near the cathedral the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>483</span>
baptistery of St John (11th century), built on the foundations
of a Roman building, is surrounded by walls and numerous
remains of the period, partly uncovered by excavations. The
church of St Lawrence (14th century) contains the tomb and
statue of Bertrand du Guesclin, whose ashes were afterwards
carried to St Denis.</p>

<p>Le Puy possesses fragmentary remains of its old line of fortifications,
among them a machicolated tower, which has been
restored, and a few curious old houses dating from the 12th
to the 17th century. In front of the hospital there is a fine
medieval porch under which a street passes. Of the modern
monuments the statue of Marie Joseph Paul, marquis of La
Fayette, and a fountain in the Place de Breuil, executed in
marble, bronze and syenite, may be specially mentioned. The
museum, named after Charles Crozatier, a native sculptor and
metal-worker to whose munificence it principally owes its
existence, contains antiquities, engravings, a collection of lace,
and ethnographical and natural history collections. Among the
curiosities of Le Puy should be noted the church of St Michel
d&rsquo;Aiguilhe, beside the gate of the town, perched on an isolated
rock like Mont Corneille, the top of which is reached by a staircase
of 271 steps. The church dates from the end of the 10th century
and its chancel is still older. The steeple is of the same type
as that of the cathedral. Three miles from Le Puy are the ruins
of the Château de Polignac, one of the most important feudal
strongholds of France.</p>

<p>Le Puy is the seat of a bishopric, a prefect and a court of
assizes, and has tribunals of first instance and of commerce,
a board of trade arbitration, a chamber of commerce, and a
branch of the Bank of France. Its educational institutions
include ecclesiastical seminaries, lycées and training colleges
for both sexes and municipal industrial schools of drawing,
architecture and mathematics applied to arts and industries.
The principal manufacture is that of lace and guipure (in woollen,
linen, cotton, silk and gold and silver threads), and distilling,
leather-dressing, malting and the manufacture of chocolate and
cloth are carried on. Cattle, woollens, grain and vegetables
are the chief articles of trade.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is not known whether Le Puy existed previously to the Roman
invasion. Towards the end of the 4th or beginning of the 5th
century it became the capital of the country of the Vellavi, at which
period the bishopric, originally at Revession, now St Paulien, was
transferred hither. Gregory of Tours speaks of it by the name of
Anicium, because a chapel &ldquo;ad Deum&rdquo; had been built on the
mountain, whence the name of Mont Adidon or Anis, which it still
retains. In the 10th century it was called Podium Sanctae Mariae,
whence Le Puy. In the middle ages there was a double enclosure,
one for the cloister, the other for the town. The sanctuary of
Nôtre Dame was much frequented by pilgrims, and the city grew
famous and populous. Rivalries between the bishops who held
directly of the see of Rome and had the right of coining money, and
the lords of Polignac, revolts of the town against the royal authority,
and the encroachments of the feudal superiors on municipal prerogatives
often disturbed the quiet of the town. The Saracens in the
8th century, the Routiers in the 12th, the English in the 14th, the
Burgundians in the 15th, successively ravaged the neighbourhood.
Le Puy sent the flower of its chivalry to the Crusades in 1096,
and Raymond d&rsquo;Aiguille, called d&rsquo;Agiles, one of its sons, was their
historian. Many councils and various assemblies of the states of
Languedoc met within its walls; popes and sovereigns, among the
latter Charlemagne and Francis I., visited its sanctuary. Pestilence
and the religious wars put an end to its prosperity. Long occupied
by the Leaguers, it did not submit to Henry IV. until many years
after his accession.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LERDO DE TEJADA, SEBASTIAN<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> (1825-1889), president
of Mexico, was born at Jalapa on the 25th of April 1825. He
was educated as a lawyer and became a member of the supreme
court. He became known as a liberal leader and a supporter
of President Juarez. He was minister of foreign affairs for
three months in 1857, and became president of the Chamber
of Deputies in 1861. During the French intervention and
the reign of the emperor Maximilian he continued loyal to
the patriotic party, and had an active share in conducting the
national resistance. He was minister of foreign affairs to
President Juarez, and he showed an implacable resolution in
carrying out the execution of Maximilian at Querétaro. When
Juarez died in 1872 Lerdo succeeded him in office in the midst
of a confused civil war. He achieved some success in pacifying
the country and began the construction of railways. He was
re-elected on the 24th of July 1876, but was expelled in January
of the following year by Porfirio Diaz. He had made himself
unpopular by the means he took to secure his re-election and by
his disposition to limit state rights in favour of a strongly
centralized government. He fled to the United States and
died in obscurity at New York in 1889.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÉRIDA,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> a province of northern Spain, formed in 1833 of
districts previously included in the ancient province of Catalonia,
and bounded on the N. by France and Andorra, E. by Gerona
and Barcelona, S. by Tarragona and W. by Saragossa and
Huesca. Pop. (1900) 274,590; area 4690 sq. m. The northern
half of Lérida belongs entirely to the Mediterranean or eastern
section of the Pyrenees, and comprises some of the finest scenery
in the whole chain, including the valleys of Aran and La Cerdaña,
and large tracts of forest. It is watered by many rivers, the
largest of which is the Segre, a left-hand tributary of the Ebro.
South of the point at which the Segre is joined on the right by
the Noguera Pallaresa, the character of the country completely
alters. The Llaños de Urgel, which comprise the greater part of
southern Lérida, are extensive plains forming part of the Ebro
valley, but redeemed by an elaborate system of canals from the
sterility which characterizes so much of that region in Aragon.
Lérida is traversed by the main railway from Barcelona to
Saragossa, and by a line from Tarragona to the city of Lérida.
In 1904 the Spanish government agreed with France to carry
another line to the mouth of an international tunnel through the
Pyrenees. Industries are in a more backward condition than in
any other province of Catalonia, despite the abundance of water-power.
There are, however, many saw-mills, flour-mills, and
distilleries of alcohol and liqueurs, besides a smaller number of
cotton and linen factories, paper-mills, soap-works, and oil and
leather factories. Zinc, lignite and common salt are mined, but
the output is small and of slight value. There is a thriving trade
in wine, oil, wool, timber, cattle, mules, horses and sheep, but
agriculture is far less prosperous than in the maritime provinces
of Catalonia. Lérida (<i>q.v.</i>) is the capital (pop. 21,432), and
the only town with more than 5000 inhabitants. Séo de
Urgel, near the headwaters of the Segre, is a fortified city
which has been an episcopal see since 840, and has had a
close historical connexion with Andorra (<i>q.v.</i>). Solsona, on a
small tributary of the Cardoner, which flows through Barcelona
to the Mediterranean, is the <i>Setelix</i> of the Romans, and contains
in its parish church an image of the Virgin said to possess
miraculous powers, and visited every year by many hundreds
of pilgrims. Cervera, on a small river of the same name,
contains the buildings of a university which Philip V. established
here in 1717. This university had originally been founded at
Barcelona in the 15th century, and was reopened there in 1842.
In character, and especially in their industry, intelligence and
keen local patriotism, the inhabitants of Lérida are typical
Catalans. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Catalonia</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÉRIDA,<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> the capital of the Spanish province of Lérida, on the
river Segre and the Barcelona-Saragossa and Lérida-Tarragona
railways. Pop. (1900) 21,432. The older parts of the city, on
the right bank of the river, are a maze of narrow and crooked
streets, surrounded by ruined walls and a moat, and commanded
by the ancient citadel, which stands on a height overlooking
the plains of Noguera on the north and of Urgel on the south.
On the left bank, connected with the older quarters by a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>484</span>
stone bridge and an iron railway bridge, are the suburbs, laid out
after 1880 in broad and regular avenues of modern houses. The
old cathedral, last used for public worship in 1707, is a very
interesting late Romanesque building, with Gothic and Mauresque
additions; but the interior was much defaced by its conversion
into barracks after 1717. It was founded in 1203 by Pedro II.
of Aragon, and consecrated in 1278. The fine octagonal belfry
was built early in the 15th century. A second cathedral, with
a Corinthian façade, was completed in 1781. The church of San
Lorenzo (1270-1300) is noteworthy for the beautiful tracery of
its Gothic windows; its nave is said to have been a Roman
temple, converted by the Moors into a mosque and by Ramon
Berenguer IV., last count of Barcelona, into a church. Other
interesting buildings are the Romanesque town hall, founded in
the 13th century but several times restored, the bishop&rsquo;s palace
and the military hospital, formerly a convent. The museum
contains a good collection of Roman and Romanesque antiquities;
and there are a school for teachers, a theological seminary and
academies of literature and science. Leather, paper, glass, silk,
linen and cloth are manufactured in the city, which has also
some trade in agricultural produce.</p>

<p>Lérida is the <i>Ilerda</i> of the Romans, and was the capital of the
people whom they called <i>Ilerdenses</i> (Pliny) or <i>Ilergetes</i> (Ptolemy).
By situation the key of Catalonia and Aragon, it was from a very
early period an important military station. In the Punic wars
it sided with the Carthaginians and suffered much from the
Roman arms. In its immediate neighbourhood Hanno was
defeated by Scipio in 216 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and it afterwards became famous
as the scene of Caesar&rsquo;s arduous struggle with Pompey&rsquo;s generals
Afranius and Petreius in the first year of the civil war (49 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).
It was already a <i>municipium</i> in the time of Augustus, and enjoyed
great prosperity under later emperors. Under the Visigoths
it became an episcopal see, and at least one ecclesiastical council
is recorded to have met here (in 546). Under the Moors <i>Lareda</i>
became one of the principal cities of the province of Saragossa;
it became tributary to the Franks in 793, but was reconquered
in 797. In 1149 it fell into the hands of Ramon Berenguer IV.
In modern times it has come through numerous sieges, having
been taken by the French in November 1707 during the War of
Succession, and again in 1810. In 1300 James II. of Aragon
founded a university at Lérida, which achieved some repute in
its day, but was suppressed in 1717, when the university of
Cervera was founded.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LERMA, FRANCISCO DE SANDOVAL Y ROJAS,<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> <span class="sc">Duke of</span>
(1552-1625), Spanish minister, was born in 1552. At the
age of thirteen he entered the royal palace as a page. The
family of Sandoval was ancient and powerful, but under Philip II.
(1556-1598) the nobles, with the exception of a few who held
viceroyalties or commanded armies abroad, had little share in
the government. The future duke of Lerma, who was by descent
marquis of Denia, passed his life as a courtier, and possessed
no political power till the accession of Philip III. in 1598. He had
already made himself a favourite with the prince, and was in fact
one of the incapable men who, as the dying king Philip II. foresaw,
were likely to mislead the new sovereign. The old king&rsquo;s
fears were fully justified. No sooner was Philip III. king than he
entrusted all authority to his favourite, whom he created duke
of Lerma in 1599 and on whom he lavished an immense list of
offices and grants. The favour of Lerma lasted for twenty years,
till it was destroyed by a palace intrigue carried out by his own
son. Philip III. not only entrusted the entire direction of his
government to Lerma, but authorized him to affix the royal
signature to documents, and to take whatever presents were
made to him. No royal favourite was ever more amply trusted,
or made a worse use of power. At a time when the state was
practically bankrupt, he encouraged the king in extravagance,
and accumulated for himself a fortune estimated by contemporaries
at forty-four millions of ducats. Lerma was pious withal,
spending largely on religious houses, and he carried out the
ruinous measures for the expulsion of the Moriscoes in 1610&mdash;a
policy which secured him the admiration of the clergy and was
popular with the mass of the nation. He persisted in costly and
useless hostilities with England till, in 1604, Spain was forced
by exhaustion to make peace, and he used all his influence against
a recognition of the independence of the Low Countries. The
fleet was neglected, the army reduced to a remnant, and the
finances ruined beyond recovery. His only resources as a finance
minister were the debasing of the coinage, and foolish edicts
against luxury and the making of silver plate. Yet it is probable
that he would never have lost the confidence of Philip III., who
divided his life between festivals and prayers, but for the domestic
treachery of his son, the duke of Uceda, who combined with the
king&rsquo;s confessor, Aliaga, whom Lerma had introduced to the
place, to turn him out. After a long intrigue in which the king
was all but entirely dumb and passive, Lerma was at last compelled
to leave the court, on the 4th of October 1618. As a
protection, and as a means of retaining some measure of power
in case he fell from favour, he had persuaded Pope Paul V. to
create him cardinal, in the year of his fall. He retired to the
town of Lerma in Old Castile, where he had built himself a
splendid palace, and then to Valladolid. Under the reign of
Philip IV., which began in 1621 he was despoiled of part of his
wealth, and he died in 1625.</p>

General de España</i> of Modesto Lafuente (Madrid, 1855)&mdash;with

<p><span class="bold">LERMONTOV, MIKHAIL YUREVICH<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> (1814-1841), Russian
poet and novelist, often styled the poet of the Caucasus, was
born in Moscow, of Scottish descent, but belonged to a respectable
family of the Tula government, and was brought up in the village
of Tarkhanui (in the Penzensk government), which now preserves
his dust. By his grandmother&mdash;on whom the whole care of his
childhood was devolved by his mother&rsquo;s early death and his
father&rsquo;s military service&mdash;no cost nor pains was spared to give
him the best education she could think of. The intellectual atmosphere
which he breathed in his youth differed little from that
in which Pushkin had grown up, though the domination of French
had begun to give way before the fancy for English, and Lamartine
shared his popularity with Byron. From the academic gymnasium
in Moscow Lermontov passed in 1830 to the university, but
there his career came to an untimely close through the part
he took in some acts of insubordination to an obnoxious teacher.
From 1830 to 1834 he attended the school of cadets at St Petersburg,
and in due course he became an officer in the guards.
To his own and the nation&rsquo;s anger at the loss of Pushkin (1837)
the young soldier gave vent in a passionate poem addressed
to the tsar, and the very voice which proclaimed that, if Russia
took no vengeance on the assassin of her poet, no second poet
would be given her, was itself an intimation that a poet had come
already. The tsar, however, seems to have found more impertinence
than inspiration in the address, for Lermontov was
forthwith sent off to the Caucasus as an officer of dragoons.
He had been in the Caucasus with his grandmother as a boy of
ten, and he found himself at home by yet deeper sympathies
than those of childish recollection. The stern and rocky virtues
of the mountaineers against whom he had to fight, no less than
the scenery of the rocks and mountains themselves, proved
akin to his heart; the emperor had exiled him to his native land.
He was in St Petersburg in 1838 and 1839, and in the latter
year wrote the novel, <i>A Hero of Our Time</i>, which is said to have
been the occasion of the duel in which he lost his life in July 1841.
In this contest he had purposely selected the edge of a precipice,
so that if either combatant was wounded so as to fall his fate
should be sealed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lermontov published only one small collection of poems in 1840.
Three volumes, much mutilated by the censorship, were issued in
1842 by Glazounov; and there have been full editions of his works
in 1860 and 1863. To Bodenstedt&rsquo;s German translation of his
poems (<i>Michail Lermontov&rsquo;s poetischer Nachlass</i>, Berlin, 1842,
2 vols.), which indeed was the first satisfactory collection, he is
indebted for a wide reputation outside of Russia. His novel has
found several translators (August Boltz, Berlin, 1852, &amp;c.). Among
his best-known pieces are &ldquo;Ismail-Bey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hadji Abrek,&rdquo; &ldquo;Walerik,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Novice,&rdquo; and, remarkable as an imitation of the old Russian
ballad, &ldquo;The song of the tsar Ivan Vasilivitch, his young bodyguard,
and the bold merchant Kalashnikov.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEROUX, PIERRE<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> (1798-1871), French philosopher and
economist, was born at Bercy near Paris on the 7th of April 1798,
the son of an artisan. His education was interrupted by the
death of his father, which compelled him to support his mother
and family. Having worked first as a mason and then as a
compositor, he joined P. Dubois in the foundation of <i>Le Globe</i>
which became in 1831 the official organ of the Saint-Simonian
community, of which he became a prominent member. In
November of the same year, when Enfantin preached the enfranchisement
of women and the functions of the <i>couple-prêtre</i>,
Leroux separated himself from the sect. In 1838, with J.
Regnaud, who had seceded with him, he founded the <i>Encyclopédie
nouvelle</i> (eds. 1838-1841). Amongst the articles which
he inserted in it were <i>De l&rsquo;égalité</i> and <i>Réfutation de l&rsquo;éclectisme</i>,
which afterwards appeared as separate works. In 1840 he
published his treatise <i>De l&rsquo;humanité</i> (2nd ed. 1845), which
contains the fullest exposition of his system, and was regarded as
the philosophical manifesto of the Humanitarians. In 1841
he established the <i>Revue indépendante</i>, with the aid of George
Sand, over whom he had great influence. Her <i>Spiridion</i>, which
was dedicated to him, <i>Sept cordes de la lyre</i>, <i>Consuelo</i>, and <i>La
Comtesse de Rudolstadt</i>, were written under the Humanitarian
inspiration. In 1843 he established at Boussac (Creuse) a printing
association organized according to his systematic ideas,
and founded the <i>Revue sociale</i>. After the outbreak of the
revolution of 1848 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly,
and in 1849 to the Legislative Assembly, but his speeches on
behalf of the extreme socialist wing were of so abstract and
mystical a character that they had no effect. After the <i>coup
d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851 he settled with his family in Jersey, where he
pursued agricultural experiments and wrote his socialist poem
<i>La Grève de Samarez</i>. On the definitive amnesty of 1869 he
returned to Paris, where he died in April 1871, during the
Commune.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The writings of Leroux have no permanent significance in the
history of thought. He was the propagandist of sentiments and
aspirations rather than the expounder of a systematic theory. He
has, indeed, a system, but it is a singular medley of doctrines
borrowed, not only from Saint-Simonian, but from Pythagorean
and Buddhistic sources. In philosophy his fundamental principle
is that of what he calls the &ldquo;triad&rdquo;&mdash;a triplicity which he finds to
pervade all things, which in God is &ldquo;power, intelligence and love,&rdquo;
in man &ldquo;sensation, sentiment and knowledge.&rdquo; His religious doctrine
is Pantheistic; and, rejecting the belief in a future life as
commonly conceived, he substitutes for it a theory of metempsychosis.
In social economy his views are very vague; he preserves
the family, country and property, but finds in all three, as they now
are, a despotism which must be eliminated. He imagines certain
combinations by which this triple tyranny can be abolished, but his
solution seems to require the creation of families without heads,
countries without governments and property without rights of
possession. In politics he advocates absolute equality&mdash;a democracy
pushed to anarchy.</p>

of February 1842. In 1866 he published <i>Une troupe de comédiens</i>,
and afterwards <i>Essai sur la restauration de nos monuments historiques
devant l&rsquo;art et devant le budget</i>, which deals particularly with
the restoration of the cathedral of Evreux. He visited Russia in
order to collect documents on the political and economic organization
of the Slav nations, and on his return published in the
<i>Revue des deux mondes</i> (1882-1889) a series of articles, which
appeared shortly afterwards in book form under the title <i>L&rsquo;Empire
des tsars et les Russes</i> (4th ed., revised in 3 vols., 1897-1898).
The work entitled <i>Un empereur, un roi, un pape, une restauration</i>.
published in 1879, was an analysis and criticism of the
politics of the Second Empire. <i>Un homme d&rsquo;état russe</i> (1884)
gave the history of the emancipation of the serfs by Alexander II.
Other works are <i>Les Catholiques libéraux, l&rsquo;église et le libéralisme</i>
(1890), <i>La Papauté, le socialisme et la démocracie</i> (1892), <i>Les
Juifs et l&rsquo;antisémitisme; Israël chez les nations</i> (1893), <i>Les
Arméniens et la question arménienne</i> (1896), <i>L&rsquo;Antisémitisme</i>
(1897), <i>Études russes et européennes</i> (1897). These writings,
mainly collections of articles and lectures intended for the general
public, display enlightened views and wide information. In 1881
Leroy-Beaulieu was elected professor of contemporary history
and eastern affairs at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques,
becoming director of this institution on the death of Albert
Sorel in 1906, and in 1887 he became a member of the Académie
des Sciences Morales et Politiques.</p>

newly-founded École Libre des Sciences Politiques, and in 1880
he succeeded his father-in-law, Michel Chevalier, in the chair of
political economy in the Collège de France. Several of his works
have made their mark beyond the borders of his own country.
Among these may be mentioned his <i>Recherches économiques,

<p><span class="bold">LERWICK,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> a municipal and police burgh of Shetland, Scotland,
the most northerly town in the British Isles. Pop. (1901)
4281. It is situated on Brassay Sound, a fine natural harbour,
on the east coast of the island called Mainland, 115 m. N.E. of
Kirkwall, in Orkney, and 340 m. from Leith by steamer. The
town dates from the beginning of the 17th century, and the older
part consists of a flagged causeway called Commercial Street,
running for 1 m. parallel with the sea (in which the gable ends of
several of the quaint-looking houses stand), and so narrow
in places as not to allow of two vehicles passing each other. At
right angles to this street lanes ascend the hill-side to Hillhead,
where the more modern structures and villas have been built.
At the north end stands Fort Charlotte, erected by Cromwell,
repaired in 1665 by Charles II. and altered in 1781 by George III.,
after whose queen it was named. It is now used as a depôt
for the Naval Reserve, for whom a large drill hall was added.
The Anderson Institute, at the south end, was constructed as a
secondary school in 1862 by Arthur Anderson, a native, who
also presented the Widows&rsquo; Asylum in the same quarter, an
institution intended by preference for widows of Shetland
sailors. The town-hall, built in 1881, contains several stained-glass
windows, two of which were the gift of citizens of Amsterdam
and Hamburg, in gratitude for services rendered by the
islanders to fishermen and seamen of those ports. Lerwick&rsquo;s
main industries are connected with the fisheries, of which it is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>486</span>
important centre. Docks, wharves, piers, curing stations and
warehouses have been provided or enlarged to cope with the
growth of the trade, and an esplanade has been constructed
along the front. The town is also the chief distributing agency
for the islands, and carries on some business in knitted woollen
goods. One mile west of Lerwick is Clickimin Loch, separated
from the sea by a narrow strip of land. On an islet in the lake
stands a ruined &ldquo;broch&rdquo; or round tower.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LE SAGE, ALAIN RENÉ<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> (1668-1747), French novelist and
dramatist, was born at Sarzeau in the peninsula of Rhuys,
between the Morbihan and the sea, on the 13th of December 1668.
Rhuys was a legal district, and Claude le Sage, the father of
the novelist, held the united positions of advocate, notary and
registrar of its royal court. His wife&rsquo;s name was Jeanne Brenugat.
Both father and mother died when Le Sage was very young, and
his property was wasted or embezzled by his guardians. Little
is known of his youth except that he went to school with the
Jesuits at Vannes until he was eighteen. Conjecture has it that
he continued his studies at Paris, and it is certain that he was
called to the bar at the capital in 1692. In August 1694 he
married the daughter of a joiner, Marie Elizabeth Huyard.
She was beautiful but had no fortune, and Le Sage had little
practice. About this time he met his old schoolfellow, the
dramatist Danchet, and is said to have been advised by him
to betake himself to literature. He began modestly as a translator,
and published in 1695 a French version of the <i>Epistles</i>
of Aristaenetus, which was not successful. Shortly afterwards
he found a valuable patron and adviser in the abbé de Lyonne,
who bestowed on him an annuity of 600 livres, and recommended
him to exchange the classics for Spanish literature, of which he
was himself a student and collector.</p>

<p>Le Sage began by translating plays chiefly from Rojas and
Lope de Vega. <i>Le Traitre puni</i> and <i>Le Point d&rsquo;honneur</i> from
the former, <i>Don Félix de Mendoce</i> from the latter, were acted or
published in the first two or three years of the 18th century.
In 1704 he translated the continuation of <i>Don Quixote</i> by
Avellaneda, and soon afterwards adapted a play from Calderon,
<i>Don César Ursin</i>, which had a divided fate, being successful at
court and damned in the city. He was, however, nearly forty
before he obtained anything like decided success. But in 1707
his admirable farce of <i>Crispin rival de son maître</i> was acted
with great applause, and <i>Le Diable boiteux</i> was published.
This latter went through several editions in the same year, and
was frequently reprinted till 1725, when Le Sage altered and
improved it considerably, giving it its present form. Notwithstanding
the success of <i>Crispin</i>, the actors did not like Le Sage,
and refused a small piece of his called <i>Les Étrennes</i> (1707). He
thereupon altered it into <i>Turcaret</i>, his theatrical masterpiece, and
one of the best comedies in French literature. This appeared
in 1709. Some years passed before he again attempted romance
writing, and then the first two parts of <i>Gil Blas de Santillane</i>
appeared in 1715. Strange to say, it was not so popular as <i>Le
Diable boiteux</i>. Le Sage worked at it for a long time, and did
not bring out the third part till 1724, nor the fourth till 1735.
For this last he had been part paid to the extent of a hundred
pistoles some years before its appearance. During these twenty
years he was, however, continually busy. Notwithstanding the
great merit and success of <i>Turcaret</i> and <i>Crispin</i>, the Théâtre
Français did not welcome him, and in the year of the publication
of <i>Gil Blas</i> he began to write for the Théâtre de la Foire&mdash;the
comic opera held in booths at festival time. This, though not a
very dignified occupation, was followed by many writers of distinction
at this date, and by none more assiduously than by
Le Sage. According to one computation he produced, either
alone or with others, about a hundred pieces, varying from
strings of songs with no regular dialogues, to comediettas only
distinguished from regular plays by the introduction of music.
He was also industrious in prose fiction. Besides finishing
<i>Gil Blas</i> he translated the <i>Orlando innamorato</i> (1721), rearranged
<i>Guzman d&rsquo;Alfarache</i> (1732), published two more or less original
novels, <i>Le Bachelier de Salamanque</i> and <i>Estévanille Gonzales</i>,
and in 1733 produced the <i>Vie et aventures de M. de Beauchesne</i>,
which is curiously like certain works of Defoe. Besides all this,
Le Sage was also the author of <i>La Valise trouvée</i>, a collection of
imaginary letters, and of some minor pieces, of which <i>Une
journée des parques</i> is the most remarkable. This laborious
life he continued until 1740, when he was more than seventy
years of age. His eldest son had become an actor, and Le Sage
had disowned him, but the second was a canon at Boulogne in
comfortable circumstances. In the year just mentioned his father
and mother went to live with him. At Boulogne Le Sage spent
the last seven years of his life, dying on the 17th of November
1747. His last work, <i>Mélange amusant de saillies d&rsquo;esprit et
de traits historiques les plus frappants</i>, had appeared in 1743.</p>

<p>Not much is known of Le Sage&rsquo;s life and personality, and
the foregoing paragraph contains not only the most important
but almost the only facts available for it. The few anecdotes
which we have of him represent him as a man of very independent
temper, declining to accept the condescending patronage which
in the earlier part of the century was still the portion of men of
letters. Thus it is said that, on being remonstrated with, as he
thought impolitely, for an unavoidable delay in appearing at the
duchess of Bouillon&rsquo;s house to read <i>Turcaret</i>, he at once put the
play in his pocket and retired, refusing absolutely to return.
It may, however, be said that as in time so in position he occupies
a place apart from most of the great writers of the 17th and 18th
centuries respectively. He was not the object of royal patronage
like the first, nor the pet of <i>salons</i> and coteries like the second.
Indeed, he seems all his life to have been purely domestic in his
habits, and purely literary in his interests.</p>

<p>The importance of Le Sage in French and in European literature
is not entirely the same, and he has the rare distinction of being
more important in the latter than in the former. His literary
work may be divided into three parts. The first contains his
Théâtre de la Foire and his few miscellaneous writings, the second
his two remarkable plays <i>Crispin</i> and <i>Turcaret</i>, the third his
prose fictions. In the first two he swims within the general
literary current in France; he can be and must be compared
with others of his own nation. But in the third he emerges
altogether from merely national comparison. It is not with
Frenchmen that he is to be measured. He formed no school in
France; he followed no French models. His work, admirable
as it is from the mere point of view of style and form, is a parenthesis
in the general development of the French novel. That
product works its way from Madame de la Fayette through
Marivaux and Prévost, not through Le Sage. His literary
ancestors are Spaniards, his literary contemporaries and successors
are Englishmen. The position is almost unique; it is
certainly interesting and remarkable in the highest degree.</p>

<p>Of Le Sage&rsquo;s miscellaneous work, including his numerous
farce-operettas, there is not much to be said except that they
are the very best kind of literary hack-work. The pure and
original style of the author, his abundant wit, his cool, humoristic
attitude towards human life, which wanted only greater earnestness
and a wider conception of that life to turn it into true
humour, are discernible throughout. But this portion of his
work is practically forgotten, and its examination is incumbent
only on the critic. <i>Crispin</i> and <i>Turcaret</i> show a stronger and
more deeply marked genius, which, but for the ill-will of the
actors, might have gone far in this direction. But Le Sage&rsquo;s
peculiar unwillingness to attempt anything absolutely new
discovered itself here. Even when he had devoted himself
to the Foire theatre, it seems that he was unwilling to attempt,
when occasion called for it, the absolute innovation of a piece
with only one actor, a crux which Alexis Piron, a lesser but a
bolder genius, accepted and carried through. <i>Crispin</i> and
<i>Turcaret</i> are unquestionably Molièresque, though they are
perhaps more original in their following of Molière than any
other plays that can be named. For this also was part of Le
Sage&rsquo;s idiosyncrasy that, while he was apparently unable or
unwilling to strike out an entirely novel line for himself, he had
no sooner entered upon the beaten path than he left it to follow
his own devices. <i>Crispin rival de son maître</i> is a farce in one
act and many scenes, after the earlier manner of motion. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>487</span>
plot is somewhat extravagant, inasmuch as it lies in the effort
of a knavish valet, not as usual to further his master&rsquo;s interests,
but to supplant that master in love and gain. But the charm
of the piece consists first in the lively bustling action of the
short scenes which take each other up so promptly and smartly
that the spectator has not time to cavil at the improbability
of the action, and secondly in the abundant wit of the dialogue.
<i>Turcaret</i> is a far more important piece of work and ranks high
among comedies dealing with the actual society of their time.
The only thing which prevents it from holding the very highest
place is a certain want of unity in the plot. This want, however,
is compensated in <i>Turcaret</i> by the most masterly profusion of
character-drawing in the separate parts. Turcaret, the ruthless,
dishonest and dissolute financier, his vulgar wife as dissolute
as himself, the harebrained marquis, the knavish chevalier, the
baroness (a coquette with the finer edge taken off her fine-ladyhood,
yet by no means unlovable), are each and all finished
portraits of the best comic type, while almost as much may be
said of the minor characters. The style and dialogue are also
worthy of the highest praise; the wit never degenerates into
mere &ldquo;wit-combats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is, however, as a novelist that the world has agreed to
remember Le Sage. A great deal of unnecessary labour has
been spent on the discussion of his claims to originality. What
has been already said will give a sufficient clue through this
thorny ground. In mere form Le Sage is not original. He
does little more than adopt that of the Spanish picaroon romance
of the 16th and 17th century. Often, too, he prefers merely
to rearrange and adapt existing work, and still oftener to give
himself a kind of start by adopting the work of a preceding
writer as a basis. But it may be laid down as a positive truth
that he never, in any work that pretends to originality at all,
is guilty of anything that can fairly be called plagiarism. Indeed
we may go further, and say that he is very fond of asserting
or suggesting his indebtedness when he is really dealing with
his own funds. Thus the <i>Diable boiteux</i> borrows the title, and
for a chapter or two the plan and almost the words, of the
<i>Diablo Cojuelo</i> of Luis Velez de Guevara. But after a few
pages Le Sage leaves his predecessor alone. Even the plan of the
Spanish original is entirely discarded, and the incidents, the
episodes, the style, are as independent as if such a book as the
<i>Diablo Cojuelo</i> had never existed. The case of <i>Gil Blas</i> is still
more remarkable. It was at first alleged that Le Sage had
borrowed it from the <i>Marcos de Obregon</i> of Vincent Espinel,
a curiously rash assertion, inasmuch as that work exists and is
easily accessible, and as the slightest consultation of it proves
that, though it furnished Le Sage with separate incidents and
hints for more than one of his books, <i>Gil Blas</i> as a whole is not
in the least indebted to it. Afterwards Father Isla asserted
that <i>Gil Blas</i> was a mere translation from an actual Spanish
book&mdash;an assertion at once incapable of proof and disproof,
inasmuch as there is no trace whatever of any such book. A
third hypothesis is that there was some manuscript original
which Le Sage may have worked up in his usual way, in the
same way, for instance, as he professes himself to have worked
up the <i>Bachelor of Salamanca</i>. This also is in the nature of it
incapable of refutation, though the argument from the <i>Bachelor</i>
is strong against it, for there could be no reason why Le Sage
should be more reticent of his obligations in the one case than
in the other. Except, however, for historical reasons, the
controversy is one which may be safely neglected, nor is there
very much importance in the more impartial indication of
sources&mdash;chiefly works on the history of Olivares&mdash;which
has sometimes been attempted. That Le Sage knew Spanish
literature well is of course obvious; but there is as little doubt
(with the limitations already laid down) of his real originality
as of that of any great writer in the world. <i>Gil Blas</i> then remains
his property, and it is admittedly the capital example of its
own style. For Le Sage has not only the characteristic, which
Homer and Shakespeare have, of absolute truth to human nature
as distinguished from truth to this or that national character,
but he has what has been called the quality of detachment,
which they also have. He never takes sides with his characters
as Fielding (whose master, with Cervantes, he certainly was)
sometimes does. Asmodeus and Don Cleofas, Gil Blas and the
Archbishop and Doctor Sangrado, are produced by him with
exactly the same impartiality of attitude. Except that he
brought into novel writing this highest quality of artistic truth,
it perhaps cannot be said that he did much to advance prose
fiction in itself. He invented, as has been said, no new <i>genre</i>;
he did not, as Marivaux and Prévost did, help on the novel as
distinguished from the romance. In form his books are undistinguishable,
not merely from the Spanish romances which
are, as has been said, their direct originals, but from the medieval
<i>romans d&rsquo;aventures</i> and the Greek prose romances. But in
individual excellence they have few rivals. Nor should it be
forgotten, as it sometimes is, that Le Sage was a great master
of French style, the greatest unquestionably between the classics
of the 17th century and the classics of the 18th. He is perhaps
the last great writer before the decadence (for since the time
of Paul Louis Courier it has not been denied that the <i>philosophe</i>
period is in point of style a period of decadence). His style is
perfectly easy at the same time that it is often admirably epigrammatic.
It has plenty of colour, plenty of flexibility, and may
be said to be exceptionally well fitted for general literary work.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The dates of the original editions of Le Sage&rsquo;s most important
works have already been given. He published during his life a
collection of his regular dramatic works, and also one of his pieces
for the Foire, but the latter is far from exhaustive; nor is there
any edition which can be called so, though the <i>&OElig;uvres choisies</i> of
1782 and 1818 are useful, and there are so-called <i>&OElig;uvres complètes</i>
of 1821 and 1840. Besides critical articles by the chief literary
critics and historians, the work of Eugène Lintilhac, in the Grands
<i>écrivains français</i> (1893), should be consulted. The <i>Diable boiteux</i>
and <i>Gil Blas</i> have been reprinted and translated numberless times.
Both will be found conveniently printed, together with <i>Estévanille
Gonzales</i> and <i>Guzman d&rsquo;Alfarache</i>, the best of the minor novels, in
four volumes of Garnier&rsquo;s <i>Bibliothèque amusante</i> (Paris, 1865).
<i>Turcaret</i> and <i>Crispin</i> are to be found in all collected editions of the
French drama. There is a useful edition of them, with ample
specimens of Le Sage&rsquo;s work for the Foire, in two volumes (Paris,
1821).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LES ANDELYS,<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> a town of northern France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Eure about 30 m. S.E. of
Rouen by rail. Pop. (1906) 3955. Les Andelys is formed by
the union of Le Grand Andely and Le Petit Andely, the latter
situated on the right bank of the Seine, the former about half a mile
from the river. Grand Andely, founded, according to tradition,
in the 6th century, has a church (13th, 14th and 15th centuries)
parts of which are of fine late Gothic and Renaissance architecture.
The works of art in the interior include beautiful stained
glass of the latter period. Other interesting buildings are the
hôtel du Grand Cerf dating from the first half of the 16th century,
and the chapel of Sainte-Clotilde, close by a spring which, owing
to its supposed healing powers, is the object of a pilgrimage.
Grand Andely has a statue of Nicolas Poussin, a native of the
place. Petit Andely sprang up at the foot of the eminence on
which stands the château Gaillard, now in ruins, but formerly
one of the strongest fortresses in France (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fortification and
Siegecraft</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Castle</a></span>). It was built by Richard C&oelig;ur
de Lion at the end of the 12th century to protect the Norman
frontier, was captured by the French in 1204 and passed finally
into their possession in 1449. The church of St Sauveur at
Petit Andely also dates from the end of the 12th century. Les
Andelys is the seat of a sub-prefect and of a tribunal of first
instance, has a preparatory infantry school; it carries on silk
milling, and the manufacture of leather, organs and sugar.
It has trade in cattle, grain, flour, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LES BAUX,<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> a village of south-eastern France, in the department
of Bouches-du-Rhône, 11 m. N.E. of Arles by road. Pop.
(1906) 111. Les Baux, which in the middle ages was a flourishing
town, is now almost deserted. Apart from a few inhabited
dwellings, it consists of an assemblage of ruined towers, fallen
walls and other débris, which cover the slope of a hill crowned by
the remains of a huge château, once the seat of a celebrated &ldquo;court
of love.&rdquo; The ramparts, a medieval church, the château, parts
of which date to the 11th century, and many of the dwellings are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>488</span>
in great part, hollowed out of the white friable limestone on
which they stand. Here and there may be found houses preserving
carved façades of Renaissance workmanship. Les Baux has
given its name to the reddish rock (bauxite) which is plentiful
in the neighbourhood and from which aluminium is obtained.
In the middle ages Les Baux was the seat of a powerful family
which owned the Terre Baussenques, extensive domains in
Provence and Dauphiné. The influence of the seigneurs de Baux
in Provence declined before the power of the house of Anjou,
to which they abandoned many of their possessions. In 1632
the château and the ramparts were dismantled.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESBONAX,<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> of Mytilene, Greek sophist and rhetorician,
flourished in the time of Augustus. According to Photius (<i>cod.</i> 74)
he was the author of sixteen political speeches, of which two are
extant, a hortatory speech after the style of Thucydides, and a
speech on the Corinthian War. In the first he exhorts the
Athenians against the Spartans, in the second (the title of which
is misleading) against the Thebans (edition by F. Kiehr, <i>Lesbonactis

also attributed to him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESBOS<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> (Mytilene, Turk. <i>Midullu</i>), an island in the Aegean
sea, off the coast of Mysia, N. of the entrance of the Gulf of
Smyrna, forming the main part of a sanjak in the archipelago
vilayet of European Turkey. It is divided into three districts,
Mytilene or Kastro in the E., Molyvo in the N., and Calloni in the
W. Since the middle ages it has been known as Mytilene, from
the name of its principal town. Strabo estimated the circumference
of the island at 1100 stadia, or about 138 m., and Scylax
reckoned it seventh in size of the islands of the Mediterranean.
The width of the channel between it and the mainland varies
from 7 to 10 m. The island is roughly triangular in shape; the
three points are Argennum on the N.E., Sigrium (Sigri) on the
W., and Malea (Maria) on the S.E. The Euripus Pyrrhaeus
(Calloni) is a deep gulf on the west between Sigrium and Malea.
The country though mountainous is very fertile, Lesbos being
celebrated in ancient times for its wine, oil and grain. Homer
refers to its wealth. Its chief produce now is olives, which also
form its principal export. Soap, skins and valonea are also
exported, and mules and cattle are extensively bred. The sardine
fishery is an important trade, and antimony, marble and coal
are found on the island. The surface is rugged and mountainous,
the highest point, Mount Olympus (Hagios Elias) being 3080 ft.
The island has suffered from periodical earthquakes. The roads
were remade in 1889, and there is telegraphic communication on
the island, and to the mainland by cable. The ports are Sigri
and Mytilene. The Gulf of Calloni and Hiera or Olivieri can
only be entered by vessels of small draught.</p>

<p>The chief town, called Mytilene, is built in amphitheatre shape
round a small hill crowned by remains of an ancient fortress.
There are now 14 mosques and 7 churches, including a cathedral.
It was originally built on an island close to the eastern coast of
Lesbos, and afterwards when the town became too large for the
island, it was joined to Lesbos by a causeway, and the city spread
along the coast. There was a harbour on each side of the small
island. Maloeis, by some surmised to be the northern of these,
was not far away. Besides the five cities which gave the island
the name of Pentapolis (Mytilene, Methymna, Antissa, Eresus,
Pyrrha), there was a town called Arisba, destroyed by an earthquake
in the time of Herodotus. Professor Conze thinks that
this is the site now called Palaikastro, N.E. of Calloni. Pyrrha
lay S.E. of Calloni, and is now also called Palaikastro. Antissa
was on the N. coast near Sigri. It was destroyed by the Romans
in 168 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Eresus was also near Sigri on the S. coast. Methymna
was on the N. coast, on the site of Molyvo, still the second
city of the island. The name Methymna is derived from the wine
(Gr. <span class="grk" title="methy">&#956;&#941;&#952;&#965;</span>) for which it was famous. Considerable remains of
town walls and other buildings are to be seen on all these
sites.</p>
<div class="author">(E. Gr.)</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Although the position of Lesbos near the old-established
trade-route to the Hellespont marks it out as an
important site even in pre-historic days, no evidence on the early
condition of the island is as yet obtainable, beyond the Greek
tradition which represented it at the time of the Trojan war
as inhabited by an original stock of Pelasgi and an immigrant
population of Ionians. In historic times it was peopled by
an &ldquo;Aeolian&rdquo; race who reckoned Boeotia as their motherland
and claimed to have migrated about 1050 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; its principal
nobles traced their pedigree to Orestes, son of Agamemnon.
Lesbos was the most prominent of Aeolian settlements, and
indeed played a large part in the early development of Greek
life. Its commercial activity is attested by several colonies in
Thrace and the Troad, and by the participation of its traders in
the settlement of Naucratis in Egypt; hence also the town of
Mytilene, by virtue of its good harbour, became the political
capital of the island. The climax of its prosperity was reached
about 600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when a citizen named Pittacus was appointed as
<i>aesymnetes</i> (dictator) to adjust the balance between the governing
nobility and the insurgent commons and by his wise administration
and legislation won a place among the Seven Sages of Greece.
These years also constitute the golden age of Lesbian culture.
The lyric poetry of Greece, which owed much to two Lesbians
of the 7th century, the musician Terpander and the dithyrambist
Arion, attained the standard of classical excellence under
Pittacus&rsquo; contemporaries Alcaeus and Sappho. In the 6th
century the importance of the island declined, partly through
a protracted and unsuccessful struggle with Athens for the
possession of Sigeum near the Hellespont, partly through a
crushing naval defeat inflicted by Polycrates of Samos (about
550). The Lesbians readily submitted to Persia after the fall of
Croesus of Lydia, and although hatred of their tyrant Coës, a
Persian protégé, drove them to take part in the Ionic revolt (499-493),
they made little use of their large navy and displayed poor
spirit at the decisive battle of Lade. In the 5th century Lesbos
for a long time remained a privileged member of the Delian
League (<i>q.v.</i>), with full rights of self-administration, and under
the sole obligation of assisting Athens with naval contingents.
Nevertheless at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War the
ruling oligarchy of Mytilene forced on a revolt, which was ended
after a two years&rsquo; siege of that town (429-427). The Athenians,
who had intended to punish the rebels by a wholesale execution,
contented themselves with killing the ringleaders, confiscating
the land and establishing a garrison. In the later years of the
war Lesbos was repeatedly attacked by the Peloponnesians,
and in 405 the harbour of Mytilene was the scene of a battle
between the admirals Callicratidas and Conon. In 389 most of
the island was recovered for the Athenians by Thrasybulus;
in 377 it joined the Second Delian League, and remained throughout
a loyal member, although in the second half of the century
the dominant democracy was for a while supplanted by a tyranny.
In 334 Lesbos served as a base for the Persian admiral Memnon
against Alexander the Great. During the Third Macedonian war
the Lesbians sided with Perseus against Rome; similarly in 88
they became eager allies of Mithradates VI. of Pontus, and
Mytilene stood a protracted siege on his behalf. This town,
nevertheless, was raised by Pompey to the status of a free community,
thanks no doubt to his confidant Theophanes, a native
of Mytilene.</p>

<p>Of the other towns on the island, Antissa, Eresus and Pyrrha
possess no separate history. Methymna in the 5th and 4th
centuries sometimes figures as a rival of Mytilene, with an
independent policy. Among the distinguished Lesbians, in
addition to those cited, may be mentioned the cyclic poet
Lesches, the historian Hellanicus and the philosophers Theophrastus
and Cratippus.</p>

<p>During the Byzantine age the island, which now assumes the
name of Mytilene, continued to flourish. In 1091 it fell for a
while into the hands of the Seljuks, and in the following century
was repeatedly occupied by the Venetians. In 1224 it was
recovered by the Byzantine emperors, who in 1354 gave it as a
dowry to the Genoese family Gattilusio. After prospering under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>489</span>
their administration Mytilene passed in 1462 under Turkish
control, and has since had an uneventful history. The present
population is about 130,000 of whom 13,000 are Turks and
Moslems and 117,000 Greeks.</p>

He was educated at the École Militaire, which he left at the age

Régiment de Royal-Piémont, but being opposed to the ideas
of the Revolution he emigrated in 1791; he soon, however,

in the defence of the Tuileries against the mob of Paris. The
day after, he was forced to leave Paris, and took refuge in the
château of Clisson near Bressuire. On the outbreak of the
revolt of Vendée against the Republic, he was arrested and
imprisoned with all his family, as one of the promoters of the

one of their leaders, fighting at Thouars, taking Fontenay and
Saumur (May-June 1793), and, after an unsuccessful attack
on Nantes, joining H. du Verger de la Rochejaquelein, another
famous Vendean leader. Their peasant troops, opposed to
the republican general F. J. Westermann, sustained various
defeats, but finally gained a victory between Tiffauges and
Cholet on the 19th of September 1793. The struggle was then
concentrated round Chatillon, which was time after time taken

constable of France, was born at Saint-Bonnet de Champsaur
on the 1st of April 1543, of a family of notaries with pretensions
to nobility. He was educated at Avignon under a Protestant
tutor, and had begun the study of law in Paris when he enlisted
as an archer. He served under the lieutenant-general of his
native province of Dauphiné, Bertrand de Simiane, baron de
Gordes, but when the Huguenots raised troops in Dauphiné
Lesdiguières threw in his lot with them, and under his kinsman
Antoine Rambaud de Furmeyer, whom he succeeded in 1570,
distinguished himself in the mountain warfare that followed
by his bold yet prudent handling of troops. He fought at Jarnac
and Moncontour, and was a guest at the wedding of Henry IV.
of Navarre. Warned of the impending massacre he retired
hastily to Dauphiné, where he secretly equipped and drilled
a determined body of Huguenots, and in 1575, after the execution
of Montbrun, became the acknowledged leader of the Huguenot
resistance in the district with the title of commandant general,
confirmed in 1577 by Marshal Damville, by Condé in 1580,
and by Henry of Navarre in 1582. He seized Gap by a lucky
night attack on the 3rd of January 1577, re-established the
reformed religion there, and fortified the town. He refused to
acquiesce in the treaty of Poitiers (1578) which involved the
surrender of Gap, and after two years of fighting secured better
terms for the province. Nevertheless in 1580 he was compelled
to hand the place over to Mayenne and to see the fortifications
dismantled. He took up arms for Henry IV. in 1585, capturing
Chorges, Embrun, Châteauroux and other places, and after
the truce of 1588-1589 secured the complete submission of
Dauphiné. In 1590 he beat down the resistance of Grenoble,
and was now able to threaten the leaguers and to support the
governor of Provence against the raids of Charles Emmanuel I.
of Savoy. He defeated the Savoyards at Esparron in April
1591, and in 1592 began the reconquest of the marquessate of
Saluzzo which had been seized by Charles Emmanuel. After
his defeat of the Spanish allies of Savoy at Salebertrano in
June 1593 there was a truce, during which Lesdiguières was
occupied in maintaining the royal authority against Éperon
in Provence. The war with Savoy proceeded intermittently
until 1601, when Henry IV. concluded peace, much to the
dissatisfaction of Lesdiguières. The king regarded his lieutenant&rsquo;s
domination in Dauphiné with some distrust, although he was
counted among the best of his captains. Nevertheless he made
him a marshal of France in 1609, and ensured the succession
to the lieutenant-generalship of Dauphiné, vested in Lesdiguières
since 1597, to his son-in-law Charles de Créquy. Sincerely
devoted to the throne, Lesdiguières took no part in the intrigues
which disturbed the minority of Louis XIII., and he moderated
the political claims made by his co-religionists under the terms
of the Edict of Nantes. After the death of his first wife, Claudine
de Bérenger, he married the widow of Ennemond Matel, a
Grenoble shopkeeper, who was murdered in 1617. Lesdiguières
was then 73, and this lady, Marie Vignon, had long been his
mistress. He had two daughters, one of whom, Françoise,
married Charles de Créquy. In 1622 he formally abjured the
Protestant faith, his conversion being partly due to the influence
of Marie Vignon. He was already a duke and peer of France;
he now became constable of France, and received the order of
the Saint Esprit. He had long since lost the confidence of the
Huguenots, but he nevertheless helped the Vaudois against
the duke of Savoy. Lesdiguières had the qualities of a great
general, but circumstances limited him to the mountain warfare
of Dauphiné, Provence and Savoy. He had almost unvarying
success through sixty years of fighting. His last campaign,
fought in alliance with Savoy to drive the Spaniards from the
Valtelline, was the least successful of his enterprises. He died
of fever at Valence on the 21st of September 1626.</p>

<p>The life of the Huguenot captain has been written in detail by
Ch. Dufuyard, <i>Le Connétable de Lesdiguières</i> (Paris, 1892). His first
biographer was his secretary Louis Videl, <i>Histoire de la vie du
connestable de Lesdiguières</i> (Paris, 1638). Much of his official correspondence,
with an admirable sketch of his life, is contained in <i>Actes
et correspondance du connétable de Lesdiguières</i>, edited by Comte
Douglas and J. Roman in <i>Documents historiques inédits pour servir
à l&rsquo;histoire de Dauphiné</i> (Grenoble, 1878). Other letters are in the

<p><span class="bold">LESGHIANS,<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lesghis</span> (from the Persian <i>Leksi</i>, called
Leki by the Grusians or Georgians, Armenians and Ossetes),
the collective name for a number of tribes of the eastern Caucasus,
who, with their kinsfolk the Chechenzes, have inhabited
Daghestan from time immemorial. They spread southward
into the Transcaucasian circles Kuba, Shemakha, Nukha and
Sakataly. They are mentioned as <span class="grk" title="Lêchai">&#923;&#8134;&#967;&#945;&#953;</span> by Strabo and Plutarch
along with the <span class="grk" title="Gêlai">&#915;&#8134;&#955;&#945;&#953;</span> (perhaps the modern Galgai, a Chechenzian
tribe), and their name occurs frequently in the chronicles of
the Georgians, whose territory was exposed to their raids for
centuries, until, on the surrender (1859) to Russia of the
Chechenzian chieftain Shamyl, they became Russian subjects.
Moses of Chorene mentions a battle in the reign of the Armenian
king Baba (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 370-377), in which Shagir, king of the Lekians,
was slain. The most important of the Lesghian tribes are the
Avars (<i>q.v.</i>), the Kasimukhians or Lakians, the Darghis and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id="page490"></a>490</span>
Kurins or Lesghians proper. Komarov<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> gives the total number
of the tribes as twenty-seven, all speaking distinct dialects.
Despite this, the Lesghian peoples, with the exception of the
Udi and Kubatschi, are held to be ethnically identical. The
Lesghians are not usually so good-looking as the Circassians or
the Chechenzes. They are tall, powerfully built, and their
hybrid descent is suggested by the range of colouring, some of
the tribes exhibiting quite fair, others quite dark, individuals.
Among some there is an obvious mongoloid strain. In disposition
they are intelligent, bold and persistent, and capable of
reckless bravery, as was proved in their struggle to maintain
their independence. They are capable of enduring great physical
fatigue. They live a semi-savage life on their mountain slopes,
for the most part living by hunting and stock-breeding. Little
agriculture is possible. Their industries are mainly restricted
to smith-work and cutlery and the making of felt cloaks, and
the women weave excellent shawls. They are for the most part
fanatical Mahommedans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESINA<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (Serbo-Croatian, <i>Hvar</i>), an island in the Adriatic
Sea, forming part of Dalmatia, Austria. Lesina lies between the
islands of Brazza on the north and Curzola on the south; and
is divided from the peninsula of Sabbioncello by the Narenta
channel. Its length is 41 m.; its greatest breadth less than 4 m.
It has a steep rocky coast with a chain of thinly wooded
limestone hills. The climate is mild, and not only the grape and
olive, but dates, figs and the carob or locust-bean flourish.
The cultivation of these fruits, boat-building, fishing and the
preparation of rosemary essence and liqueurs are the principal
resources of the islanders. Lesina (<i>Hvar</i>) and Cittavecchia
(<i>Starigrad</i>) are the principal towns and seaports, having respectively
2138 and 3120 inhabitants. Lesina, the capital, contains
an arsenal, an observatory and some interesting old buildings
of the 16th century. It is a Roman Catholic bishopric, and the
centre of an administrative district, which includes Cittavecchia,
Lissa, and some small neighbouring islands. Pop. (1900) of island
18,091, of district 27,928.</p>

<p>To the primitive &ldquo;Illyrian&rdquo; race, whose stone cists and bronze
implements have been disinterred from barrows near the capital,
may perhaps be attributed the &ldquo;Cyclopean&rdquo; walls at Cittavecchia.
About 385 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, a Greek colony from Paros built a city
on the site of the present Lesina, naming it <i>Paros</i> or <i>Pharos</i>.
The forms <i>Phara</i>, <i>Pharia</i> (common among Latin writers), and
<i>Pityeia</i>, also occur. In 229 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the island was betrayed to the
Romans by Demetrius, lieutenant of the Illyrian queen Teuta;
but in 219, as Demetrius proved false to Rome also, his capital
was razed by Lucius Aemilius Paullus. <i>Neos Pharos</i>, now
Cittavecchia, took its place, and flourished until the 6th century,
when the island was laid waste by barbarian invaders. Constantine
Porphyrogenitus mentions Lesina as a colony of pagan
Slavs, in the 10th century. Throughout the middle ages it
remained a purely Slavonic community; and its name, which
appears in old documents as <i>Lisna</i>, <i>Lesna</i> or <i>Lyesena</i>, &ldquo;wooded&rdquo;
is almost certainly derived from the Slavonic <i>lyés</i>, &ldquo;forest,&rdquo; not
from the Italian <i>lesina</i>, &ldquo;an awl.&rdquo; But the old form Pharia
persisted, as <i>Far</i> or <i>Hvar</i>, with the curious result that the modern
Serbo-Croatian name is Greek, and the modern Italian name
Slavonic in origin. Lesina became a bishopric in 1145, and
received a charter from Venice in 1331. It was sacked by the
enemies of Venice in 1354 and 1358; ceded to Hungary in the
same year; held by Ragusa from 1413 to 1416; and incorporated
in the Venetian dominions in 1420. During the 16th century
Lesina city had a considerable maritime trade, and, though
sacked and partly burned by the Turks in 1571, it remained
the chief naval station of Venice, in these waters, until 1776,
when it was superseded by Curzola. Passing to Austria in 1797,
and to France in 1805, it withstood a Russian attack in 1807,
but was surrendered by the French in 1813, and finally annexed
to Austria in 1815.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESION<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (through Fr. from Lat. <i>laesio</i>, injury, <i>laedere</i>, to hurt),
an injury, hurt, damage. In Scots law the term is used of
damage suffered by a party in a contract sufficient to enable
him to bring an action for setting it aside. In pathology, the
chief use, the word is applied to any morbid change in the
structure of an organ, whether shown by visible changes or by
disturbance of function.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESKOVATS<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Leskovatz</span> or <span class="sc">Leskovac</span>), a town in Servia,
between Nish and Vranya, on the railway line from Nish to
Salonica. Pop. (1901) 13,707. It is the headquarters of the
Servian hemp industry, the extensive plain in which the town
lies growing the best flax and hemp in all the Balkan peninsula.
The plain is not only the most fertile portion of Servia, but also
the best cultivated. Besides flax and hemp, excellent tobacco
is grown. Five valleys converge on the plain from different
directions, and the inhabitants of the villages in these valleys
are all occupied in growing flax and hemp, which they send to
Leskovats to be stored or manufactured into ropes. After
Belgrade and Nish, Leskovats is the most prosperous town in
Servia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESLEY, JOHN<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (1527-1596), Scottish bishop and historian,
was born in 1527. His father was Gavin Lesley, rector of
Kingussie. He was educated at the university of Aberdeen,
where he took the degree of M.A. In 1538 he obtained a dispensation
permitting him to hold a benefice, notwithstanding
his being a natural son, and in June 1546 he was made an acolyte
in the cathedral church of Aberdeen, of which he was afterwards
appointed a canon and prebendary. He also studied at Poitiers,
at Toulouse and at Paris, where he was made doctor of laws
in 1553. In 1558 he took orders and was appointed Official
of Aberdeen, and inducted into the parsonage and prebend of
Oyne. At the Reformation Lesley became a champion of
Catholicism. He was present at the disputation held in Edinburgh
in 1561, when Knox and Willox were his antagonists.
He was one of the commissioners sent the same year to bring
over the young Queen Mary to take the government of
Scotland. He returned in her train, and was appointed a
privy councillor and professor of canon law in King&rsquo;s College,
Aberdeen, and in 1565 one of the senators of the college of
justice. Shortly afterwards he was made abbot of Lindores,
and in 1565 bishop of Ross, the election to the see being
confirmed in the following year. He was one of the sixteen
commissioners appointed to revise the laws of Scotland, and the
volume of the <i>Actis and Constitutionis of the Realme of Scotland</i>
known as the Black Acts was, chiefly owing to his care, printed
in 1566.</p>

<p>The bishop was one of the most steadfast friends of Queen Mary.
After the failure of the royal cause, and whilst Mary was a captive
in England, Lesley (who had gone to her at Bolton) continued to
exert himself on her behalf. He was one of the commissioners
at the conference at York in 1568. He appeared as her
ambassador at the court of Elizabeth to complain of the injustice
done to her, and when he found he was not listened to, he laid
plans for her escape. He also projected a marriage for her with
the duke of Norfolk, which ended in the execution of that nobleman.
For this he was put under the charge of the bishop of
London, and then of the bishop of Ely (in Holborn), and afterwards
imprisoned in the Tower of London. During his confinement
he collected materials for his history of Scotland, by which
his name is now chiefly known. In 1571 he presented the latter
portion of this work, written in Scots, to Queen Mary to amuse
her in her captivity. He also wrote for her use his <i>Piae Consolationes</i>,
and the queen devoted some of the hours of her captivity
to translating a portion of it into French verse.</p>

<p>In 1573 he was liberated from prison, but was banished from
England. For two years he attempted unsuccessfully to obtain
the assistance of Continental princes in favour of Queen Mary.
While at Rome in 1578 he published his Latin history <i>De Origine,
Moribus, et Rebus Gestis Scotorum</i>. In 1579 he went to France,
and was made suffragan and vicar-general of the archbishopric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>491</span>
of Rouen. Whilst visiting his diocese, however, he was thrown
into prison, and had to pay 3000 pistoles to prevent his being
given up to Elizabeth. During the remainder of the reign of
Henry III. he lived unmolested, but on the accession of the
Protestant Henry IV. he again fell into trouble. In 1590 he
was thrown into prison, and had to purchase his freedom at the
same expense as before. In 1593 he was made bishop of Coutances
in Normandy, and had licence to hold the bishopric of
Ross till he should obtain peaceable possession of the former see.
He retired to an Augustinian monastery near Brussels, where he
died on the 31st of May 1596.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief works of Lesley are as follows: <i>A Defence of the Honour
of ... Marie, Queene of Scotland, by Eusebius Dicaeophile</i> (London,
1569), reprinted, with alterations, at Liége in 1571, under the title,
<i>A Treatise concerning the Defence of the Honour of Marie, Queene of
Scotland, made by Morgan Philippes, Bachelar of Divinitie, Piae
afflicti animi consolationes, ad Mariam Scot. Reg.</i> (Paris, 1574);
<i>De origine, moribus et rebus gestis Scotorum libri decem</i> (Rome, 1578;
re-issued 1675); <i>De illustrium feminarum in republica administranda
authoritate libellus</i> (Reims, 1580; a Latin version of a tract on
&ldquo;The Lawfulness of the Regiment of Women&rdquo;: cf. Knox&rsquo;s
pamphlet); <i>De titulo et jure Mariae Scot. Reg., quo regni Angliae
successionem sibi juste vindicat</i> (Reims, 1580; translated in 1584).
The history of Scotland from 1436 to 1561 owes much, in its earlier
chapters, to the accounts of Hector Boece (<i>q.v.</i>) and John Major (<i>q.v.</i>),
though no small portion of the topographical matter is first-hand.
In the later sections he gives an independent account (from the
Catholic point of view) which is a valuable supplement and a corrective
in many details, to the works of Buchanan and Knox. A Scots
version of the history was written in 1596 by James Dalrymple of
the Scottish Cloister at Regensburg. It has been printed for the
Scottish Text Society (2 vols., 1888-1895) under the editorship of
the Rev. E. G. Cody, O.S.B. A slight sketch by Lesley of Scottish
history from 1562 to 1571 has been translated by Forbes-Leith in
his <i>Narrative of Scottish Catholics</i> (1885), from the original MS. now
in the Vatican.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESLEY, J. PETER<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> (1819-1903), American geologist, was born
in Philadelphia on the 17th of September 1819. It is recorded by
Sir A. Geikie that &ldquo;He was christened Peter after his father
and grandfather, and at first wrote his name &lsquo;Peter Lesley, Jr.,&rsquo;
but disliking the Christian appellation that had been given to
him, he eventually transformed his signature by putting the J.
of &lsquo;Junior&rsquo; at the beginning.&rdquo; He was educated for the ministry
at the university of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1838;
but the effects of close study having told upon his health, he
served for a time as sub-assistant on the first geological survey
of Pennsylvania under Professor H. D. Rogers, and was afterwards
engaged in a special examination of the coal regions.
On the termination of the survey in 1841 he entered Princeton
seminary and renewed his theological studies, at the same time
giving his leisure time to assist Professor Rogers in preparing
the final report and map of Pennsylvania. He was licensed to
preach in 1844; he then paid a visit to Europe and entered on a
short course of study at the university of Halle. Returning to
America he worked during two years for the American Tract
Society, and at the close of 1847 he joined Professor Rogers
again in preparing geological maps and sections at Boston. He
then accepted the pastorate of the Congregational church at
Milton, a suburb of Boston, where he remained until 1851, when,
his views having become Unitarian, he abandoned the ministry
and entered into practice as a consulting geologist. In the course
of his work he made elaborate surveys of the Cape Breton coalfield,
and of other coal and iron regions. From 1855 to 1859
he was secretary of the American Iron Association; for twenty-seven
years (1858-1885) he was secretary and librarian of the
American Philosophical Society; from 1872 to 1878 he was
professor of geology and dean of the faculty of science in the
university of Pennsylvania, and from 1874-1893 he was in charge
of the second geological survey of the state. He then retired
to Milton, Mass., where he died on the 1st of June 1903. He
published <i>Manual of Coal and its Topography</i> (1856); <i>The Iron
Manufacturer&rsquo;s Guide to the Furnaces, Forges and Rolling Mills
of the United States</i> (1859).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESLIE, CHARLES<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> (1650-1722), Anglican nonjuring divine,
son of John Leslie (1571-1671), bishop of Raphoe and afterwards
of Clogher, was born in July 1650 in Dublin, and was educated
at Enniskillen school and Trinity College, Dublin. Going to
England he read law for a time, but soon turned his attention
to theology, and took orders in 1680. In 1687 he became
chancellor of the cathedral of Connor and a justice of the peace,
and began a long career of public controversy by responding in
public disputation at Monaghan to the challenge of the Roman
Catholic bishop of Clogher. Although a vigorous opponent of
Roman Catholicism, Leslie was a firm supporter of the Stuart
dynasty, and, having declined at the Revolution to take the oath
to William and Mary, he was on this account deprived of his
benefice. In 1689 the growing troubles in Ireland induced him
to withdraw to England, where he employed himself for the next
twenty years in writing various controversial pamphlets in
favour of the nonjuring cause, and in numerous polemics against
the Quakers, Jews, Socinians and Roman Catholics, and especially
in that against the Deists with which his name is now most
commonly associated. He had the keenest scent for every form
of heresy and was especially zealous in his defence of the sacraments.
A warrant having been issued against him in 1710 for
his pamphlet <i>The Good Old Cause, or Lying in Truth</i>, he resolved
to quit England and to accept an offer made by the Pretender
(with whom he had previously been in frequent correspondence)
that he should reside with him at Bar-le-Duc. After the failure
of the Stuart cause in 1715, Leslie accompanied his patron into
Italy, where he remained until 1721, in which year, having found
his sojourn amongst Roman Catholics extremely unpleasant,
he sought and obtained permission to return to his native country.
He died at Glaslough, Monaghan, on the 13th of April 1722.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Theological Works</i> of Leslie were collected and published by
himself in 2 vols. folio in 1721; a later edition, slightly enlarged,
appeared at Oxford in 1832 (7 vols. 8vo). Though marred by persistent
arguing in a circle they are written in lively style and show
considerable erudition. He had the somewhat rare distinction of
making several converts by his reasonings, and Johnson declared
that &ldquo;Leslie was a reasoner, and a reasoner who was not to be
reasoned against.&rdquo; An historical interest in all that now attaches
to his subjects and his methods, as may be seen when the promise
given in the title of his best-known work is contrasted with the actual
performance. The book professes to be <i>A Short and Easy Method
with the Deists, wherein the certainty of the Christian Religion is
Demonstrated by Infallible Proof from Four Rules, which are incompatible
to any imposture that ever yet has been, or that can possibly be</i>
(1697). The four rules which, according to Leslie, have only to be
rigorously applied in order to establish not the probability merely
but the absolute certainty of the truth of Christianity are simply
these: (1) that the matter of fact be such as that men&rsquo;s outward senses,
their eyes and ears, may be judges of it; (2) that it be done publicly,
in the face of the world; (3) that not only public monuments be
kept up in memory of it, but some outward actions be performed;
(4) that such monuments and such actions or observances be instituted
and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was
done. Other publications of Leslie are <i>The Snake in the Grass</i> (1696),
against the Quakers; <i>A Short Method with the Jews</i> (1689); <i>Gallienus
Redivivus</i> (an attack on William III., 1695); <i>The Socinian Controversy
Discussed</i> (1697); <i>The True Notion of the Catholic Church</i>
(1703); and <i>The Case Stated between the Church of Rome and the
Church of England</i> (1713).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESLIE, CHARLES ROBERT<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> (1794-1859), English genre-painter,
was born in London on the 19th of October 1794. His
parents were American, and when he was five years of age he
returned with them to their native country. They settled in
Philadelphia, where their son was educated and afterwards
apprenticed to a bookseller. He was, however, mainly interested
in painting and the drama, and when George Frederick Cooke
visited the city he executed a portrait of the actor, from recollection
of him on the stage, which was considered a work
of such promise that a fund was raised to enable the young
artist to study in Europe. He left for London in 1811, bearing
introductions which procured for him the friendship of West,
Beechey, Allston, Coleridge and Washington Irving, and was
admitted as a student of the Royal Academy, where he carried
off two silver medals. At first, influenced by West and Fuseli,
he essayed &ldquo;high art,&rdquo; and his earliest important subject depicted
Saul and the Witch of Endor; but he soon discovered his true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>492</span>
aptitude and became a painter of cabinet-pictures, dealing,
not like those of Wilkie, with the contemporary life that surrounded
him, but with scenes from the great masters of fiction,
from Shakespeare and Cervantes, Addison and Molière, Swift,
Sterne, Fielding and Smollett. Of individual paintings we may
specify &ldquo;Sir Roger de Coverley going to Church&rdquo; (1819);
&ldquo;May-day in the Time of Queen Elizabeth&rdquo; (1821); &ldquo;Sancho
Panza and the Duchess&rdquo; (1824); &ldquo;Uncle Toby and the Widow
Wadman&rdquo; (1831); <i>La Malade Imaginaire</i>, act iii. sc. 6 (1843);
and the &ldquo;Duke&rsquo;s Chaplain Enraged leaving the Table,&rdquo; from
<i>Don Quixote</i> (1849). Many of his more important subjects
exist in varying replicas. He possessed a sympathetic imagination,
which enabled him to enter freely into the spirit of the author
whom he illustrated, a delicate perception for female beauty,
an unfailing eye for character and its outward manifestation
in face and figure, and a genial and sunny sense of humour,
guided by an instinctive refinement which prevented it from
overstepping the bounds of good taste. In 1821 Leslie was
elected A.R.A., and five years later full academician. In 1833
he left for America to become teacher of drawing in the military
academy at West Point, but the post proved an irksome one,
and in some six months he returned to England. He died
on the 5th of May 1859.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In addition to his skill as an artist, Leslie was a ready and pleasant
writer. His <i>Life</i> of his friend Constable, the landscape painter,
appeared in 1843, and his <i>Handbook for Young Painters</i>, a volume
embodying the substance of his lectures as professor of painting to
the Royal Academy, in 1855. In 1860 Tom Taylor edited his <i>Autobiography
and Letters</i>, which contain interesting reminiscences of his
distinguished friends and contemporaries.</p>

actor, was born at Woolwich on the 1st of April 1855. He
made his first stage appearance in London as Colonel Hardy in

great hit as Rip Van Winkle in Planquette&rsquo;s opera of that name
at the Comedy. In 1885 he appeared at the Gaiety as Jonathan
Wild in H. P. Stephens and W. Yardley&rsquo;s burlesque <i>Little Jack
Sheppard</i>. His extraordinary success in this part determined
his subsequent career, and for some years he and Nelly Farren,
with whom he played in perfect association, were the pillars of
Gaiety burlesque. Leslie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don Caesar de Bazan&rdquo; in <i>Ruy
Blas, or the Blasé Roué</i>, was perhaps the most popular of his later
parts. In all of them it was his own versatility and entertaining
personality which formed the attraction; whether he sang,
danced, whistled or &ldquo;gagged,&rdquo; his performance was an unending
flow of high spirits and ludicrous charm. Under the pseudonym
of &ldquo;A. C. Torr&rdquo; he was acknowledged on the programmes as
part-author of these burlesques, and while on occasion he acted
in more serious comedy, for which he had undoubted capacity,
his fame rests on his connexion with them. In 1881 and 1883
he played in America. He died on the 7th of December 1892.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESLIE, SIR JOHN<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span> (1766-1832), Scottish mathematician
and physicist, was born of humble parentage at Largo, Fifeshire,
on the 16th of April 1766, and received his early education there
and at Leven. In his thirteenth year, encouraged by friends
who had even then remarked his aptitude for mathematical and
physical science, he entered the university of St Andrews. On
the completion of his arts course, he nominally studied divinity
at Edinburgh until 1787; in 1788-1789 he spent rather more
than a year as private tutor in a Virginian family, and from 1790
till the close of 1792 he held a similar appointment at Etruria
in Staffordshire, with the family of Josiah Wedgwood, employing
his spare time in experimental research and in preparing
a translation of Buffon&rsquo;s <i>Natural History of Birds</i>, which was
published in nine 8vo vols. in 1793, and brought him some money.
For the next twelve years (passed chiefly in London or at Largo,
with an occasional visit to the continent of Europe) he continued
his physical studies, which resulted in numerous papers contributed
by him to Nicholson&rsquo;s <i>Philosophical Journal</i>, and in the
publication (1804) of the <i>Experimental Inquiry into the Nature
and Properties of Heat</i>, a work which gained him the Rumford
Medal of the Royal Society of London. In 1805 he was elected
to succeed John Playfair in the chair of mathematics at Edinburgh,
not, however, without violent though unsuccessful opposition
on the part of a narrow-minded clerical party who accused
him of heresy in something he had said as to the &ldquo;unsophisticated
notions of mankind&rdquo; about the relation of cause and
effect. During his tenure of this chair he published two volumes
of a <i>Course of Mathematics</i>&mdash;the first, entitled <i>Elements of Geometry,
Geometrical Analysis and Plane Trigonometry</i>, in 1809,
and the second, <i>Geometry of Curve Lines</i>, in 1813; the third
volume, on <i>Descriptive Geometry and the Theory of Solids</i> was
never completed. With reference to his invention (in 1810)
of a process of artificial congelation, he published in 1813 <i>A
Short Account of Experiments and Instruments depending on the
relations of Air to Heat and Moisture</i>; and in 1818 a paper by
him &ldquo;On certain impressions of cold transmitted from the higher
atmosphere, with an instrument (the aethrioscope) adapted to
measure them,&rdquo; appeared in the <i>Transactions of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh</i>. In 1819, on the death of Playfair, he was
promoted to the more congenial chair of natural philosophy,
which he continued to hold until his death, and in 1823 he published,
chiefly for the use of his class, the first volume of his
never-completed <i>Elements of Natural Philosophy</i>. Leslie&rsquo;s
main contributions to physics were made by the help of the
&ldquo;differential thermometer,&rdquo; an instrument whose invention was
contested with him by Count Rumford. By adapting to this
instrument various ingenious devices he was enabled to employ
it in a great variety of investigations, connected especially with
photometry, hygroscopy and the temperature of space. In
1820 he was elected a corresponding member of the Institute of
France, the only distinction of the kind which he valued, and
early in 1832 he was created a knight. He died at Coates, a
small property which he had acquired near Largo, on the 3rd of
November 1832.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LESLIE, THOMAS EDWARD CLIFFE<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> (1827-1882), English
economist, was born in the county of Wexford in (as is believed)
the year 1827. He was the second son of the Rev. Edward
Leslie, prebendary of Dromore, and rector of Annahilt, in the
county of Down. His family was of Scottish descent, but had
been connected with Ireland since the reign of Charles I.
Amongst his ancestors were that accomplished prelate, John
Leslie (1571-1671), bishop first of Raphoe and afterwards of
Clogher, who, when holding the former see, offered so stubborn
a resistance to the Cromwellian forces, and the bishop&rsquo;s son
Charles (see above), the nonjuror. Cliffe Leslie received his
elementary education from his father, who resided in England,
though holding church preferment as well as possessing some
landed property in Ireland; by him he was taught Latin, Greek
and Hebrew, at an unusually early age; he was afterwards
for a short time under the care of a clergyman at Clapham,
and was then sent to King William&rsquo;s College, in the Isle of Man,
where he remained until, in 1842, being then only fifteen years
of age, he entered Trinity College, Dublin. He was a distinguished
student there, obtaining, besides other honours, a classical
scholarship in 1845, and a senior moderatorship (gold medal)
in mental and moral philosophy at his degree examination in
1846. He became a law student at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, was for two
years a pupil in a conveyancer&rsquo;s chambers in London, and was
called to the English bar. But his attention was soon turned
from the pursuit of legal practice, for which he seems never to
have had much inclination, by his appointment, in 1853, to the
professorship of jurisprudence and political economy in Queen&rsquo;s
College, Belfast. The duties of this chair requiring only short
visits to Ireland in certain terms of each year, he continued to
reside and prosecute his studies in London, and became a frequent
writer on economic and social questions in the principal reviews
and other periodicals. In 1870 he collected a number of his
essays, adding several new ones, into a volume entitled <i>Land
Systems and Industrial Economy of Ireland, England and Continental
Countries</i>. J. S. Mill gave a full account of the contents
of this work in a paper in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, in which he
pronounced Leslie to be &ldquo;one of the best living writers on applied
political economy.&rdquo; Mill had sought his acquaintance on reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>493</span>
his first article in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i>; he admired his talents
and took pleasure in his society, and treated him with a respect
and kindness which Leslie always gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>In the frequent visits which Leslie made to the continent,
especially to Belgium and some of the less-known districts
of France and Germany, he occupied himself much in economic
and social observation, studying the effects of the institutions
and system of life which prevailed in each region, on the material
and moral condition of its inhabitants. In this way he gained
an extensive and accurate acquaintance with continental rural
economy, of which he made excellent use in studying parallel
phenomena at home. The accounts he gave of the results of
his observations were among his happiest efforts; &ldquo;no one,&rdquo;
said Mill, &ldquo;was able to write narratives of foreign visits at once
so instructive and so interesting.&rdquo; In these excursions he made
the acquaintance of several distinguished persons, amongst
others of M. Léonce de Lavergne and M. Émile de Laveleye.
To the memory of the former of these he afterwards paid a
graceful tribute in a biographical sketch (<i>Fortnightly Review</i>,
February 1881); and to the close of his life there existed between
him and M. de Laveleye relations of mutual esteem and cordial
intimacy.</p>

<p>Two essays of Leslie&rsquo;s appeared in volumes published under
the auspices of the Cobden Club, one on the &ldquo;Land System of
France&rdquo; (2nd ed., 1870), containing an earnest defence of <i>la
petite culture</i> and still more of <i>la petite propriété</i>; the other on
&ldquo;Financial Reform&rdquo; (1871), in which he exhibited in detail the
impediments to production and commerce arising from indirect
taxation. Many other articles were contributed by him to
reviews between 1875 and 1879, including several discussions of
the history of prices and the movements of wages in Europe,
and a sketch of life in Auvergne in his best manner; the most
important of them, however, related to the philosophical method
of political economy, notably a memorable one which appeared
in the Dublin University periodical, <i>Hermathena</i>. In 1879 the
provost and senior fellows of Trinity College published for him
a volume in which a number of these articles were collected under
the title of <i>Essays in Political and Moral Philosophy</i>. These and
some later essays, together with the earlier volume on <i>Land
Systems</i>, form the essential contribution of Leslie to economic
literature. He had long contemplated, and had in part written,
a work on English economic and legal history, which would have
been his <i>magnum opus</i>&mdash;a more substantial fruit of his genius and
his labours than anything he has left. But the MS. of this
treatise, after much pains had already been spent on it, was
unaccountably lost at Nancy in 1872; and, though he hoped to
be able speedily to reproduce the missing portion and finish the
work, no material was left in a state fit for publication. What
the nature of it would have been may be gathered from an essay
on the &ldquo;History and Future of Profit&rdquo; in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> for November 1881, which is believed to have been in
substance an extract from it.</p>

<p>That he was able to do so much may well be a subject of
wonder when it is known that his labours had long been impeded
by a painful and depressing malady, from which he suffered
severely at intervals, whilst he never felt secure from its recurring
attacks. To this disease he in the end succumbed at Belfast, on
the 27th of January 1882.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s work may be distributed under two heads, that of applied
political economy and that of discussion on the philosophical method
of the science. The <i>Land Systems</i> belonged principally to the former
division. The author perceived the great and growing importance
for the social welfare of both Ireland and England of what is called
&ldquo;the land question,&rdquo; and treated it in this volume at once with
breadth of view and with a rich variety of illustrative detail. His
general purpose was to show that the territorial systems of both
countries were so encumbered with elements of feudal origin as to be
altogether unfitted to serve the purposes of a modern industrial
society. The policy he recommended is summed up in the following
list of requirements, &ldquo;a simple jurisprudence relating to land, a law
of equal intestate succession, a prohibition of entail, a legal security
for tenants&rsquo; improvements, an open registration of title and transfer
and a considerable number of peasant properties.&rdquo; The volume is
full of practical good sense, and exhibits a thorough knowledge of
home and foreign agricultural economy; and in the handling of the
subject is everywhere shown the special power which its author
possessed of making what he wrote interesting as well as instructive.
The way in which sagacious observation and shrewd comment are
constantly intermingled in the discussion not seldom reminds us of
Adam Smith, whose manner was more congenial to Leslie than the
abstract and arid style of Ricardo.</p>

<p>But what, more than anything else, marks him as an original
thinker and gives him a place apart among contemporary economists,
is his exposition and defence of the historical method in
political economy. Both at home and abroad there has for some
time existed a profound and growing dissatisfaction with the method
and many of the doctrines of the hitherto dominant school, which,
it is alleged, under a &ldquo;fictitious completeness, symmetry and exactness&rdquo;
disguises a real hollowness and discordance with fact. It is
urged that the attempt to deduce the economic phenomena of a
society from the so-called universal principle of &ldquo;the desire of
wealth&rdquo; is illusory, and that they cannot be fruitfully studied apart
from the general social conditions and historic development of which
they are the outcome. Of this movement of thought Leslie was
the principal representative, if not the originator, in England.
There is no doubt, for he has himself placed it on record, that the
first influence which impelled him in the direction of the historical
method was that of Sir Henry Maine, by whose personal teaching
of jurisprudence, as well as by the example of his writings, he was
led &ldquo;to look at the present economic structure and state of society
as the result of a long evolution.&rdquo; The study of those German
economists who represent similar tendencies doubtless confirmed
him in the new line of thought on which he had entered, though he
does not seem to have been further indebted to any of them except,
perhaps, in some small degree to Roscher. And the writings of
Comte, whose &ldquo;prodigious genius,&rdquo; as exhibited in the <i>Philosophie
Positive</i>, he admired and proclaimed, though he did not accept his
system as a whole, must have powerfully co-operated to form in him
the habit of regarding economic science as only a single branch of
sociology, which should always be kept in close relation to the others.
The earliest writing in which Leslie&rsquo;s revolt against the so-called
&ldquo;orthodox school&rdquo; distinctly appears is his <i>Essay on Wages</i>, which
was first published in 1868 and was reproduced as an appendix to
the volume on <i>Land Tenures</i>. In this, after exposing the inanity
of the theory of the wage-fund, and showing the utter want of agreement
between its results and the observed phenomena, he concludes
by declaring that &ldquo;political economy must be content to take rank
as an inductive, instead of a purely deductive science,&rdquo; and that, by
this change of character, &ldquo;it will gain in utility, interest and real
truth far more than a full compensation for the forfeiture of a
fictitious title to mathematical exactness and certainty.&rdquo; But it is
in the essays collected in the volume of 1879 that his attitude in
relation to the question of method is most decisively marked. In
one of these, on &ldquo;the political economy of Adam Smith,&rdquo; he exhibits
in a very interesting way the co-existence in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
of historical-inductive investigation in the manner of Montesquieu
with a priori speculation founded on theologico-metaphysical bases,
and points out the error of ignoring the former element, which is the
really characteristic feature of Smith&rsquo;s social philosophy, and places
him in strong contrast with his <i>soi-disant</i> followers of the school of
Ricardo. The essay, however, which contains the most brilliant
polemic against the &ldquo;orthodox school,&rdquo; as well as the most luminous
account and the most powerful vindication of the new direction, was
that of which we have above spoken as having first appeared in
<i>Hermathena</i>. It may be recommended as supplying the best extant
presentation of one of the two contending views of economic method.
On this essay mainly rests the claim of Leslie to be regarded as the
founder and first head of the English historical school of political
economy. Those who share his views on the philosophical constitution
of the science regard the work he did, notwithstanding its unsystematic
character, as in reality the most important done by any
English economists in the latter half of the 19th century. But even
the warmest partisans of the older school acknowledge that he did
excellent service by insisting on a kind of inquiry, previously too
much neglected, which was of the highest interest and value, in
whatever relation it might be supposed to stand to the establishment
of economic truth. The members of both groups alike recognized
his great learning, his patient and conscientious habits of investigation
and the large social spirit in which he treated the problems of
his science.</p>

3587. It lies on the Leven, the vale of which is overlooked by
the town, 4 m. W. of Markinch by the North British railway.
The industries include paper-making, flax-spinning, bleaching
and linen-weaving. The old church claims to be the &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s
Kirk on the Green&rdquo; of the ancient ballads of that name. A
stone on the Green, called the Bull Stone, is said to have been
used when bull-baiting was a popular pastime. Leslie House,
the seat of the earl of Rothes, designed by Sir William Bruce,
rivalled Holyrood in magnificence. It was noted for its tapestry
and its gallery of family portraits and other pictures, including a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>494</span>
portrait of Rembrandt by himself. Daniel Defoe considered
its park the glory of the kingdom. The mansion sustained serious
damage from fire in 1763. Norman Leslie, master of Rothes,
was concerned in the killing of Cardinal Beaton (1546), and the
dagger with which John Leslie, Norman&rsquo;s uncle, struck the fatal
blow is preserved in Leslie House.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Markinch</span> (pop. 1499), a police burgh situated between
Conland Burn and the Leven, 7¼ m. N. by E. of Kirkcaldy by
the North British railway, is a place of great antiquity. A cell
of the Culdees was established here by one of the last of the Celtic
bishops, the site of which may possibly be marked by the ancient
cross of Balgonie. Markinch is also believed to have been a
residence of the earlier kings, where prior to the 11th century
they occasionally administered justice; and in the reign of
William the Lion (d. 1214) the warrantors of goods alleged to have
been stolen were required to appear here. Its industries comprise
bleaching, flax-spinning, paper-making, distilling and coal-mining.
Balgonie Castle, close by, the keep of which is 80 ft.
high, was a residence of Alexander Leslie, the first earl of Leven,
and at Balfour Castle were born Cardinal Beaton and his uncle
and nephew the archbishops of Glasgow.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESPINASSE, JEANNE JULIE ÉLÉONORE DE<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> (1732-1776),
French author, was born at Lyons on the 9th of November 1732.
A natural child of the comtesse d&rsquo;Albon, she was brought up as
the daughter of Claude Lespinasse of Lyons. On leaving her
convent school she became governess in the house of her mother&rsquo;s
legitimate daughter, Mme de Vichy, who had married the brother
of the marquise du Deffand. Here Mme du Deffand made her
acquaintance, and, recognizing her extraordinary gifts, persuaded
her to come to Paris as her companion. The alliance
lasted ten years (1754-1764) until Mme du Deffand became
jealous of the younger woman&rsquo;s increasing influence, when a
violent quarrel ensued. Mlle de Lespinasse set up a salon of her
own which was joined by many of the most brilliant members of
Mme du Deffand&rsquo;s circle. D&rsquo;Alembert was one of the most
assiduous of her friends and eventually came to live under the
same roof. There was no scandal attached to this arrangement,
which ensured d&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s comfort and lent influence to Mlle
de Lespinasse&rsquo;s salon. Although she had neither beauty nor
rank, her ability as a hostess made her reunions the most popular
in Paris. She owes her distinction, however, not to her social
success, but to circumstances which remained a secret during her
lifetime from her closest friends. Two volumes of <i>Lettres</i> published
in 1809 displayed her as the victim of a passion of a rare
intensity. In virtue of this ardent, intense quality Sainte Beuve
and other of her critics place her letters in the limited category
to which belong the Latin letters of Héloïse and those of the
Portuguese Nun. Her first passion, a reasonable and serious one,
was for the marquis de Mora, son of the Spanish ambassador
in Paris. De Mora had come to Paris in 1765, and with some
intervals remained there until 1772 when he was ordered to Spain
for his health. On the way to Paris in 1774 to fulfil promises
exchanged with Mlle de Lespinasse, he died at Bordeaux. But
her letters to the comte de Guibert, the worthless object of her
fatal infatuation, begin from 1773. From the struggle between
her affection for de Mora and her blind passion for her new lover
they go on to describe her partial disenchantment on Guibert&rsquo;s
marriage and her final despair. Mlle de Lespinasse died on the
23rd of May 1776, her death being apparently hastened by the
agitation and misery to which she had been for the last three
years of her life a prey. In addition to the <i>Lettres</i> she was the
author of two chapters intended as a kind of sequel to Sterne&rsquo;s
<i>Sentimental Journey</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Her <i>Lettres</i> ... were published by Mme de Guibert in 1809 and
a spurious additional collection appeared in 1820. Among modern
editions may be mentioned that of Eugène Asse (1876-1877).
<i>Lettres inédites de Mademoiselle de Lespinasse à Condorcet, à D&rsquo;Alembert,
à Guibert, au comte de Crillon</i>, edited by M. Charles Henry (1887),
contains copies of the documents available for her biography. Mrs
Humphry Ward&rsquo;s novel, <i>Lady Rose&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, owes something to
the character of Mlle de Lespinasse.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LES SABLES D&rsquo;OLONNE,<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> a seaport of western France, capital
of an arrondissement of the department of Vendée, on an inlet of
the Atlantic seaboard, 23 m. S.W. of La Roche-sur-Yon by rail.
Pop. (1906) 11,847. The town stands between the sea on the
south and the port on the north, while on the west it is separated
by a channel from the suburb of La Chaume, built at the foot of
a range of dunes 65 ft. high, which terminates southwards in the
rocky peninsula of L&rsquo;Aiguille. The beautiful smoothly sloping
beach, 1 m. in length, is much frequented by bathers. To the
north of Sables extend salt-marshes and oyster-parks, yielding
6,000,000 to 8,000,000 oysters per annum. Sables has a church
built in the Late Gothic style towards the middle of the 17th
century. The port, consisting of a tidal basin and a wet-dock, is
accessible to vessels of 2000 tons, but is dangerous when the winds
are from the south-west. The lighthouse of Barges, a mile out
at sea to the west, is visible for 17 to 18 nautical miles. The
inhabitants are employed largely in sardine and tunny fishing;
there are imports of coal, wood, petroleum and phosphates.
Boat-building and sardine-preserving are carried on. The town
has a sub-prefecture and a tribunal of first instance.</p>

<p>Founded by Basque or Spanish sailors, Sables was the first
place in Poitou invaded by the Normans in 817. Louis XI., who
went there in 1472, granted the inhabitants various privileges,
improved the harbour, and fortified the entrance. Captured and
recaptured during the Wars of Religion, the town afterwards
became a nursery of hardy sailors and privateers, who harassed
the Spaniards and afterwards the English. In 1696 Sables was
bombarded by the combined fleets of England and Holland. In
the middle of the 18th century hurricanes caused grievous
damage to town and harbour.</p>

in the department of Boûches-du-Rhône, 24 m. S.S.W. of Arles
by rail. Pop. (1906) 544. Saintes-Maries is situated in the plain
of the Camargue, 1½ m. E. of the mouth of the Petit-Rhône. It
is the object of an ancient and famous pilgrimage due to the
tradition that Mary, sister of the Virgin, and Mary, mother of
James and John, together with their black servant Sara, Lazarus,
Martha, Mary Magdalen and St Maximin fled thither to escape
persecution in Judaea. The relics of the two Maries, who are
said to have been buried at Saintes-Maries, are bestowed in the
upper storey of the apse of the fortress-church, a remarkable
building of the 12th century with crenelated and machicolated
walls. Two festivals are held in the town, a less important one
in October, the other, on the 24th and 25th of May, unique for
its gathering of gipsies who come in large numbers to do honour
to the tomb of their patroness Sara, contained in the crypt below
the apse.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESSE,<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> one of the most romantic of the smaller rivers of
Belgium. It rises at Ochamps in the Ardennes, and flowing in
a north-westerly course reaches the Meuse at Anseremme, a few
miles above Dinant. The river is only 49 m. long, but its meandering
course may be judged by the fact that it is no more than 29 m.
from Ochamps to Anseremme in a straight line. There is a good
deal of pretty scenery along this river, as, for instance, at Ciergnon,
but the most striking part of the valley is contained in the last
12 m. from Houyet to Anseremme. In this section the river is
confined between opposing walls of cliff ranging from 300 to 500 ft.
above the river. Here were discovered in the caves near Walzin
the bones of prehistoric men, and other evidence of the primitive
occupants of this globe at a period practically beyond computation.
Another curious natural feature of the Lesse is that on
reaching the hill of Han it disappears underground, reappearing
about 1 m. farther on at the village of that name. Here are the
curious and interesting Han grottoes. The Lesse receives
altogether in its short course the water of thirteen tributaries.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESSEPS, FERDINAND DE<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> (1805-1894). French diplomatist
and maker of the Suez Canal, was born at Versailles on the 19th
of November 1805. The origin of his family has been traced back
as far as the end of the 14th century. His ancestors, it is believed,
came from Scotland, and settled at Bayonne when that region
was occupied by the English. One of his great-grandfathers was
town clerk and at the same time secretary to Queen Anne of
Neuberg, widow of Charles II. of Spain, exiled to Bayonne after
the accession of Philip V. From the middle of the 18th century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page495" id="page495"></a>495</span>
the ancestors of Ferdinand de Lesseps followed the diplomatic
career, and he himself occupied with real distinction several posts
in the same calling from 1825 to 1849. His uncle was ennobled
by King Louis XVI., and his father was made a count by
Napoleon I. His father, Mathieu de Lesseps (1774-1832), was
in the consular service; his mother, Catherine de Grivégnée, was
Spanish, and aunt of the countess of Montijo, mother of the
empress Eugénie. His first years were spent in Italy, where
his father was occupied with his consular duties. He was
educated at the College of Henry IV. in Paris. From the age of
18 years to 20 he was employed in the commissary department
of the army. From 1825 to 1827 he acted as assistant vice-consul
at Lisbon, where his uncle, Barthélemy de Lesseps, was
the French chargé d&rsquo;affaires. This uncle was an old companion
of La Pérouse and a survivor of the expedition in which that
navigator perished. In 1828 Ferdinand was sent as an assistant
vice-consul to Tunis, where his father was consul-general.
He courageously aided the escape of Youssouff, pursued by the
soldiers of the bey, of whom he was one of the officers, for violation
of the seraglio law. Youssouff acknowledged this protection
given by a Frenchman by distinguishing himself in the ranks
of the French army at the time of the conquest of Algeria.
Ferdinand de Lesseps was also entrusted by his father with
missions to Marshal Count Clausel, general-in-chief of the army
of occupation in Algeria. The marshal wrote to Mathieu de
Lesseps on the 18th of December 1830: &ldquo;I have had the pleasure
of meeting your son, who gives promise of sustaining with great
credit the name he bears.&rdquo; In 1832 Ferdinand de Lesseps was
appointed vice-consul at Alexandria. To the placing in quarantine
of the vessel which took him to Egypt is due the origin of
his great conception of a canal across the isthmus of Suez.
In order to help him to while away the time at the lazaretto,
M. Mimaut, consul-general of France at Alexandria, sent him
several books, among which was the memoir written upon the
Suez Canal, according to Bonaparte&rsquo;s instructions, by the civil
engineer Lapère, one of the scientific members of the French
expedition. This work struck de Lesseps&rsquo;s imagination,
and gave him the idea of piercing the African isthmus. This
idea, moreover, was conceived in circumstances that were to
prepare the way for its realization. Mehemet Ali, who was the
viceroy of Egypt, owed his position, to a certain extent, to the
recommendations made in his behalf to the French government
by Mathieu de Lesseps, who was consul-general in Egypt when
Mehemet Ali was a simple colonel. The viceroy therefore welcomed
Ferdinand affectionately, while Said Pacha, Mehemet&rsquo;s
son, began those friendly relations that he did not forget later,
when he gave him the concession for making the Suez Canal.
In 1833 Ferdinand de Lesseps was sent as consul to Cairo,
and soon afterwards given the management of the consulate-general
at Alexandria, a post that he held until 1837. While he
was there a terrible epidemic of the plague broke out and lasted
for two years, carrying off more than a third of the inhabitants
of Cairo and Alexandria. During this time he went from one
city to the other, according as the danger was more pressing,
and constantly displayed an admirable zeal and an imperturbable
energy. Towards the close of the year 1837 he returned to
France, and on the 21st of December married Mlle Agathe
Delamalle, daughter of the government prosecuting attorney
at the court of Angers. By this marriage M. de Lesseps became
the father of five sons. In 1839 he was appointed consul at
Rotterdam, and in the following year transferred to Malaga,
the place of origin of his mother&rsquo;s family. In 1842 he was sent to
Barcelona, and soon afterwards promoted to the grade of consul-general.
In the course of a bloody insurrection in Catalonia,
which ended in the bombardment of Barcelona, Ferdinand de
Lesseps showed the most persistent bravery, rescuing from death,
without distinction, the men belonging to the rival factions, and
protecting and sending away not only the Frenchmen who were
in danger, but foreigners of all nationalities. From 1848 to
1849 he was minister of France at Madrid. In the latter year the
government of the French Republic confided to him a mission
to Rome at the moment when it was a question whether
the expelled pope would return to the Vatican with or without
bloodshed. Following his interpretation of the instructions he
had received, de Lesseps began negotiations with the existing
government at Rome, according to which Pius IX. should peacefully
re-enter the Vatican and the independence of the Romans be
assured at the same time. But while he was negotiating, the
elections in France had caused a change in the foreign policy
of the government. His course was disapproved; he was recalled
and brought before the council of state, which blamed his
conduct without giving him a chance to justify himself. Rome,
attacked by the French army, was taken by assault after a
month&rsquo;s sanguinary siege. M. de Lesseps then retired from the
diplomatic service, and never afterwards occupied any public
office. In 1853 he lost his wife and daughter at a few days&rsquo;
interval. Perhaps his energy would not have been sufficient
to sustain him against these repeated blows of destiny if, in 1854,
the accession to the viceroyalty of Egypt of his old friend, Said
Pacha, had not given a new impulse to the ideas that had
haunted him for the last twenty-two years concerning the Suez
Canal. Said Pacha invited M. de Lesseps to pay him a visit, and
on the 7th of November 1854 he landed at Alexandria; on the
30th of the same month Said Pacha signed the concession authorizing
M. de Lesseps to pierce the isthmus of Suez.</p>

<p>A first scheme, indicated by him, was immediately drawn
out by two French engineers who were in the Egyptian service,
MM. Linant Bey and Mougel Bey. This project, differing from
others that had been previously presented or that were in opposition
to it, provided for a direct communication between the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea. After being slightly modified,
the plan was adopted in 1856 by an international commission
of civil engineers to which it had been submitted. Encouraged
by this approval, de Lesseps no longer allowed anything to stop
him. He listened to no adverse criticism and receded before no
obstacle. Neither the opposition of Lord Palmerston, who
considered the projected disturbance as too radical not to
endanger the commercial position of Great Britain, nor the
opinions entertained, in France as well as in England, that
the sea in front of Port Said was full of mud which would
obstruct the entrance to the canal, that the sands from the
desert would fill the trenches&mdash;no adverse argument, in a word,
could dishearten Ferdinand de Lesseps. His faith made him
believe that his adversaries were in the wrong; but how great
must have been this faith, which permitted him to undertake
the work at a time when mechanical appliances for the execution
of such an undertaking did not exist, and when for the utilization
of the proposed canal there was as yet no steam mercantile
marine! Impelled by his convictions and talent, supported
by the emperor Napoleon III. and the empress Eugénie, he
succeeded in rousing the patriotism of the French and obtaining
by their subscriptions more than half of the capital of two
hundred millions of francs which he needed in order to form
a company. The Egyptian government subscribed for eighty
millions&rsquo; worth of shares. The company was organized at the
end of 1858. On the 25th of April 1859 the first blow of the
pickaxe was given by Lesseps at Port Said, and on the 17th
of November 1869 the canal was officially opened by the Khedive,
Ismail Pacha (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Suez Canal</a></span>). While in the interests of his
canal Lesseps had resisted the opposition of British diplomacy
to an enterprise which threatened to give to France control
of the shortest route to India, he acted loyally towards Great
Britain after Lord Beaconsfield had acquired the Suez shares
belonging to the Khedive, by frankly admitting to the board
of directors of the company three representatives of the British
government. The consolidation of interests which resulted,
and which has been developed by the addition in 1884 of seven
other British directors, chosen from among shipping merchants
and business men, has augmented, for the benefit of all concerned,
the commercial character of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Ferdinand de Lesseps steadily endeavoured to keep out of
politics. If in 1869 he appeared to deviate from this principle
by being a candidate at Marseilles for the Corps Législatif, it
was because he yielded to the entreaties of the Imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>496</span>
government in order to strengthen its goodwill for the Suez
Canal. Once this goodwill had been shown, he bore no malice
towards those who rendered him his liberty by preferring Gambetta.
He afterwards declined the other candidatures that were
offered him: for the Senate in 1876, and for the Chamber in 1877.
In 1873 he became interested in a project for uniting Europe
and Asia by a railway to Bombay, with a branch to Peking.
He subsequently encouraged Major Roudaire, who wished to
transform the Sahara desert into an inland sea. The king of the
Belgians having formed an International African Society, de
Lesseps accepted the presidency of the French committee,
facilitated M. de Brazza&rsquo;s explorations, and acquired stations
that he subsequently abandoned to the French government.
These stations were the starting-point of French Congo. In
1879 a congress assembled in the rooms of the Geographical
Society at Paris, under the presidency of Admiral de la Roncière
le Noury, and voted in favour of the making of the Panama
Canal. Public opinion, it may be declared, designated Ferdinand
de Lesseps as the head of the enterprise. It was upon that
occasion that Gambetta bestowed upon him the title of <i>Le
Grand Français</i>. He was not a man to shirk responsibility,
and notwithstanding that he had reached the age of 74, he
undertook to carry out the Panama Canal project (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Panama
Canal</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>). Politics, which de Lesseps had
always avoided, was his greatest enemy in this matter. The
winding-up of the Panama Company having been declared
in the month of December 1888, the adversaries of the French
Republic, seeking for a scandal that would imperil the government,
hoped to bring about the prosecution of the directors
of the Panama Company. Their attacks were so vigorously
made that the government was obliged, in self-defence, to have
judicial proceedings taken against Ferdinand de Lesseps, his
son Charles (b. 1849) and his co-workers Fontane and Cottu.
Charles de Lesseps, a victim offered to the fury of the politicians,
tried to divert the storm upon his head and prevent it from
reaching his father. He managed to draw down upon himself
alone the burden of the condemnations pronounced. One of
the consequences of the persecutions of which he was the object
was to oblige him to spend three years, from 1896 to 1899, in
England, where his participation in the management of the
Suez Canal had won for him some strong friendships, and where
he was able to see the great respect in which the memory and
name of his father were held by Englishmen.</p>

<p>Ferdinand de Lesseps died at La Chenaie on the 7th of
December 1894. He had contracted a second marriage in 1869
with Mlle Autard de Bragard, daughter of a former magistrate
of Mauritius; and eleven out of twelve children of this marriage
survived him. M. de Lesseps was a member of the French
Academy, of the Academy of Sciences, of numerous scientific
societies, Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour and of the Star
of India, and had received the freedom of the City of London.
According to some accounts he was unconscious of the disastrous
events that took place during the closing months of his life.
Others report that, feeling himself powerless to scatter the
gathered clouds, and aware of his physical feebleness, he had
had the moral courage to pass in the eyes of his family, which
he did not wish to afflict, as the dupe of the efforts they employed
to conceal the truth from him. This last version would not be
surprising if we relied upon the following portrait, sketched by
a person who knew him intimately:&mdash;&ldquo;Simple in his tastes,
never thinking of himself, constantly preoccupied about others,
supremely kind, he did not and would not recognize such a thing
as evil. Of a confiding nature, he was inclined to judge others
by himself. This naturally affectionate abandonment that
every one felt in him had procured him profound attachments
and rare devotions. He showed, while making the Suez Canal,
what a gift he possessed for levying the pacific armies he conducted.
He set duty above everything, had in the highest
degree a reverence for honour, and placed his indomitable courage
at the service of everything that was beneficial with an abnegation
that nothing could tire. His marvellous physical and moral
equilibrium gave him an evenness of temper which always
rendered his society charming. Whatever his cares, his work
or his troubles, I have never noticed in him aught but generous
impulses and a love of humanity carried even to those heroic
imprudences of which they alone are capable who devote themselves
to the amelioration of humanity.&rdquo; No doubt this eulogy
requires some reservations. The striking and universal success
which crowned his work on the Suez Canal gave him an absoluteness
of thought which brooked no contradiction, a despotic
temper before which every one must bow, and against which,
when he had once taken a resolution, nothing could prevail,
not even the most authoritative opposition or the most legitimate
entreaties. He had resolved to construct the Panama
Canal without locks, to make it an uninterrupted navigable
way. All attempts to dissuade him from this resolution failed
before his tenacious will. At his advanced age he went with his
youngest child to Panama to see with his own eyes the field
of his new enterprise. He there beheld the Culebra and the
Chagres; he saw the mountain and the stream, those two greatest
obstacles of nature that sought to bar his route. He paid no
heed to them, but began the struggle against the Culebra and
the Chagres. It was against them that was broken his invincible
will, sweeping away in the defeat the work of Panama, his own
fortune, his fame and almost an atom of his honour. But this
atom, only grazed by calumny, has already been restored to
him by posterity, for he died poor, having been the first to
suffer by the disaster to his illusions. Political agitators, in
order to sap the power of the Opportunist party, did not hesitate
to drag in the mud one of the greatest citizens of France. But
when the Panama &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; has been forgotten, for centuries
to come the traveller in saluting the statue of Ferdinand de
Lesseps at the entrance of the Suez Canal will pay homage to
one of the most powerful embodiments of the creative genius
of the 19th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESSING, GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> (1729-1781), German
critic and dramatist, was born at Kamenz in Upper Lusatia
(Oberlausitz), Saxony, on the 22nd of January 1729. His father,
Johann Gottfried Lessing, was a clergyman, and, a few years
after his son&rsquo;s birth, became <i>pastor primarius</i> or chief pastor of
Kamenz. After attending the Latin school of his native town,
Gotthold was sent in 1741 to the famous school of St Afra at
Meissen, where he made such rapid progress, especially in classics
and mathematics, that, towards the end of his school career, he
was described by the rector as &ldquo;a steed that needed double
fodder.&rdquo; In 1746 he entered the university of Leipzig as a
theological student. The philological lectures of Johann Friedrich
Christ (1700-1756) and Johann August Ernesti (1707-1781)
proved, however, more attractive than those on theology, and
he attended the philosophical disputations presided over by his
friend A. G. Kästner, professor of mathematics and also an
epigrammatist of repute. Among Lessing&rsquo;s chief friends in
Leipzig were C. F. Weisse (1726-1804) the dramatist, and Christlob
Mylius (1722-1754), who had made some name for himself
as a journalist. He was particularly attracted by the theatre
then directed by the talented actress Karoline Neuber (1697-1760),
who had assisted Gottsched in his efforts to bring the
German stage into touch with literature. Frau Neuber even
accepted for performance Lessing&rsquo;s first comedy, <i>Der junge
Gelehrte</i> (1748), which he had begun at school. His father
naturally did not approve of these new interests and acquaintances,
and summoned him home. He was only allowed to
return to Leipzig on the condition that he would devote himself
to the study of medicine. Some medical lectures he did attend,
but as long as Frau Neuber&rsquo;s company kept together the theatre
had an irresistible fascination for him.</p>

<p>In 1748, however, the company broke up, and Lessing, who
had allowed himself to become surety for some of the actors&rsquo;
debts, was obliged to leave Leipzig too, in order to escape their
creditors. He went to Wittenberg, and afterwards, towards
the end of the year, to Berlin, where his friend Mylius had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>497</span>
established himself as a journalist. In Berlin Lessing now spent
three years, maintaining himself chiefly by literary work. He
translated three volumes of Charles Rollin&rsquo;s <i>Histoire ancienne</i>,
wrote several plays&mdash;<i>Der Misogyn</i>, <i>Der Freigeist</i>, <i>Die Juden</i>&mdash;and
in association with Mylius, began the <i>Beiträge zur Historie
und Aufnahine des Theaters</i> (1750), a periodical&mdash;which soon
came to an end&mdash;for the discussion of matters connected with
the drama. Early in 1751 he became literary critic to the
<i>Vossische Zeitung</i>, and in this position laid the foundation for
his reputation as a reviewer of learning, judgment and wit. At
the end of 1751 he was in Wittenberg again, where he spent about
a year engaged in unremitting study and research. He then
returned to Berlin with a view to making literature his profession;
and the next three years were among the busiest of
his life. Besides translating for the booksellers, he issued several
numbers of the <i>Theatralische Bibliothek</i>, a periodical similar
to that which he had begun with Mylius; he also continued his
work as critic to the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>. In 1754 he gave a particularly
brilliant proof of his critical powers in his <i>Vademecum für
Herrn S. G. Lange</i>; as a retort to that writer&rsquo;s overbearing
criticism, Lessing exposed with scathing satire Lange&rsquo;s errors
in his popular translation of Horace.</p>

<p>By 1753 Lessing felt that his position was sufficiently assured
to allow of him issuing an edition of his collected writings
(<i>Schriften</i>, 6 vols., 1753-1755). They included his lyrics and
epigrams, most of which had already appeared during his first
residence in Berlin in a volume of <i>Kleinigkeiten</i>, published
anonymously. Much more important were the papers entitled
<i>Rettungen</i>, in which he undertook to vindicate the character
of various writers&mdash;Horace and writers of the Reformation
period, such as Cochlaeus and Cardanus&mdash;who had been misunderstood
or falsely judged by preceding generations. The
<i>Schriften</i> also contained Lessing&rsquo;s early plays, and one new one,
<i>Miss Sara Sampson</i> (1755). Hitherto Lessing had, as a dramatist,
followed the methods of contemporary French comedy as
cultivated in Leipzig; <i>Miss Sara Sampson</i>, however, marks the
beginning of a new period in the history of the German drama.
This play, based more or less on Lille&rsquo;s <i>Merchant of London</i>,
and influenced in its character-drawing by the novels of Richardson,
is the first <i>bürgerliches Trauerspiel</i>, or &ldquo;tragedy of common
life&rdquo; in German. It was performed for the first time at Frankfort-on-Oder
in the summer of 1755, and received with great
favour. Among Lessing&rsquo;s chief friends during his second
residence in Berlin were the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn
(1729-1786), in association with whom he wrote in 1755 an
admirable treatise, <i>Pope ein Metaphysiker!</i> tracing sharply
the lines which separate the poet from the philosopher. He was
also on intimate terms with C. F. Nicolai (1733-1811), a Berlin
bookseller and rationalistic writer, and with the &ldquo;German
Horace&rdquo; K. W. Ramler (1725-1798); he had also made the
acquaintance of J. W. L. Gleim (1719-1803), the Halberstadt
poet, and E. C. von Kleist (1715-1759), a Prussian officer, whose
fine poem. <i>Der Frühling</i>, had won for him Lessing&rsquo;s warm
esteem.</p>

<p>In October 1755 Lessing settled in Leipzig with a view to
devoting himself more exclusively to the drama. In 1756 he
accepted the invitation of Gottfried Winkler, a wealthy young
merchant, to accompany him on a foreign tour for three years.
They did not, however, get beyond Amsterdam, for the outbreak
of the Seven Years&rsquo; War made it necessary for Winkler
to return home without loss of time. A disagreement with his
patron shortly after resulted in Lessing&rsquo;s sudden dismissal;
he demanded compensation and, although in the end the court
decided in his favour, it was not until the case had dragged on
for about six years. At this time Lessing began the study of
medieval literature to which attention had been drawn by the
Swiss critics, Bodmer and Breitinger, and wrote occasional
criticisms for Nicolai&rsquo;s <i>Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften</i>.
In Leipzig Lessing had also an opportunity of developing his
friendship with Kleist who happened to be stationed there.
The two men were mutually attracted, and a warm affection
sprang up <span class="correction" title="amended from betweem">between</span> them. In 1758 Kleist&rsquo;s regiment being
ordered to new quarters, Lessing decided not to remain behind
him and returned again to Berlin. Kleist was mortally wounded
in the following year at the battle of Kunersdorf.</p>

<p>Lessing&rsquo;s third residence in Berlin was made memorable
by the <i>Briefe, die neueste Literatur betreffend</i> (1759-1765), a
series of critical essays&mdash;written in the form of letters to a
wounded officer&mdash;on the principal books that had appeared since
the beginning of the Seven Years&rsquo; War. The scheme was suggested
by Nicolai, by whom the <i>Letters</i> were published. In
Lessing&rsquo;s share in this publication, his critical powers and
methods are to be seen at their best. He insisted especially on
the necessity of truth to nature in the imaginative presentation
of the facts of life, and in one letter he boldly proclaimed the
superiority of Shakespeare to Corneille, Racine and Voltaire.
At the same time he marked the immutable conditions to which
even genius must submit if it is to succeed in its appeal to our
sympathies. While in Berlin at this time, he edited with Ramler
a selection from the writings of F. von Logau, an epigrammatist
of the 17th century, and introduced to the German public the
<i>Lieder eines preussischen Grenadiers</i>, by J. W. L. Gleim. In
1759 he published <i>Philotas</i>, a prose tragedy in one act, and also
a complete collection of his fables, preceded by an essay on the
nature of the fable. The latter is one of his best essays on
criticism, defining with perfect lucidity what is meant by &ldquo;action&rdquo;
in works of the imagination, and distinguishing the action of the
fable from that of the epic and the drama.</p>

<p>In 1760, feeling the need of some change of scene and work,
Lessing went to Breslau, where he obtained the post of secretary
to General Tauentzien, to whom Kleist had introduced him in
Leipzig. Tauentzien was not only a general in the Prussian army,
but governor of Breslau, and director of the mint. During the
four years which Lessing spent in Breslau, he associated chiefly
with Prussian officers, went much into society, and developed
a dangerous fondness for the gaming table. He did not, however,
lose sight of his true goal; he collected a large library, and, after
the conclusion of the Seven Years&rsquo; War, in 1763, he resumed
more enthusiastically than ever the studies which had been
partially interrupted. He investigated the early history of
Christianity and penetrated more deeply than any contemporary
thinker into the significance of Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy. He also
found time for the studies which were ultimately to appear in
the volume entitled <i>Laokoon</i>, and in fresh spring mornings he
sketched in a garden the plan of <i>Minna von Barnhelm</i>.</p>

<p>After resigning his Breslau appointment in 1765, he hoped for
a time to obtain a congenial appointment in Dresden, but nothing
came of this and he was again compelled, much against his
will, to return to Berlin. His friends there exerted themselves
to obtain for him the office of keeper of the royal library, but
Frederick had not forgotten Lessing&rsquo;s quarrel with Voltaire, and
declined to consider his claims. During the two years which
Lessing now spent in the Prussian capital, he was restless and
unhappy, yet it was during this period that he published two of
his greatest works, <i>Laokoon, oder über die Grenzen der Malerei
und Poesie</i> (1766) and <i>Minna von Barnhelm</i> (1767). The aim of
Laokoon, which ranks as a classic, not only in German but in
European literature, is to define by analysis the limitations of
poetry and the plastic arts. Many of his conclusions have been
corrected and extended by later criticism; but he indicated more
decisively than any of his predecessors the fruitful principle
that each art is subject to definite conditions, and that it can
accomplish great results only by limiting itself to its special
function. The most valuable parts of the work are those which
relate to poetry, of which he had a much more intimate knowledge
than of sculpture and painting. His exposition of the methods
of Homer and Sophocles is especially suggestive, and he may be
said to have marked an epoch in the appreciation of these writers,
and of Greek literature generally. The power of <i>Minna von
Barnhelm</i>, Lessing&rsquo;s greatest drama, was also immediately
recognized. Tellheim, the hero of the comedy, is an admirable
study of a manly and sensitive soldier, with somewhat exaggerated
ideas of conventional honour; and Minna, the heroine,
is one of the brightest and most attractive figures in German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>498</span>
comedy. The subordinate characters are conceived with even
more force and vividness; and the plot, which reflects precisely
the struggles and aspirations of the period that immediately
followed the Seven Years&rsquo; War, is simply and naturally unfolded.</p>

<p>In 1767 Lessing settled in Hamburg, where he had been invited
to take part in the establishment of a national theatre. The
scheme promised well, and, as he associated himself with Johann
Joachim Christoph Bode (1730-1793), a literary man whom he
respected, in starting a printing establishment, he hoped that he
might at last look forward to a peaceful and prosperous career.
The theatre, however, was soon closed, and the printing establishment
failed, leaving behind it a heavy burden of debt. In
despair, Lessing determined towards the end of his residence in
Hamburg to quit Germany, believing that in Italy he might
find congenial labour that would suffice for his wants. The
<i>Hamburgische Dramaturgie</i> (1767-1768), Lessing&rsquo;s commentary
on the performances of the National Theatre, is the first modern
handbook of the dramatist&rsquo;s art. By his original interpretation
of Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of tragedy, he delivered German dramatists
from the yoke of the classic tragedy of France, and directed them
to the Greek dramatists and to Shakespeare. Another result of
Lessing&rsquo;s labours in Hamburg was the <i>Antiquarische Briefe</i> (1768),
a series of masterly letters in answer to Christian Adolf Klotz
(1738-1771), a professor of the university of Halle, who, after
flattering Lessing, had attacked him, and sought to establish
a kind of intellectual despotism by means of critical journals
which he directly or indirectly controlled. In connexion with
this controversy Lessing wrote his brilliant little treatise, <i>Wie
die Alten den Tod gebildet</i> (1769), contrasting the medieval
representation of death as a skeleton with the Greek conception
of death as the twin-brother of sleep.</p>

<p>Instead of settling in Italy, as he intended, Lessing accepted
in 1770 the office of librarian at Wolfenbüttel, a post which was
offered to him by the hereditary prince of Brunswick. In this
position he passed his remaining years. For a time he was not
unhappy, but the debts which he had contracted in Hamburg
weighed heavily on him, and he missed the society of his friends;
his health, too, which had hitherto been excellent, gradually
gave way. In 1775 he travelled for nine months in Italy with
Prince Leopold of Brunswick, and in the following year he
married Eva König, the widow of a Hamburg merchant, with
whom he had been on terms of intimate friendship. But their
happiness lasted only for a brief period; in 1778 she died in
childbed.</p>

<p>Soon after settling in Wolfenbüttel, Lessing found in the
library the manuscript of a treatise by Berengarius of Tours on
transubstantiation in reply to Lanfranc. This was the occasion
of Lessing&rsquo;s powerful essay on Berengarius, in which he vindicated
the latter&rsquo;s character as a serious and consistent thinker. In
1771 he published his <i>Zerstreute Anmerkungen über das Epigramm,
und einige der vornehmsten Epigrammatisten</i>&mdash;a work which
Herder described as &ldquo;itself an epigram.&rdquo; Lessing&rsquo;s theory of
the origin of the epigram is somewhat fanciful, but no other
critic has offered so many pregnant hints as to the laws of
epigrammatic verse, or defended with so much force and ingenuity
the character of Martial. In 1772 he published <i>Emilia
Galotti</i>, a tragedy which he had begun many years before in
Leipzig. The subject was suggested by the Roman legend of
Virginia, but the scene is laid in an Italian court, and the whole
play is conceived in the spirit of the &ldquo;tragedy of common life.&rdquo;
Its defect is that its tragic conclusion does not seem absolutely
inevitable, but the characters&mdash;especially those of the Gräfin
Orsina and Marinelli, the prince of Guastalla&rsquo;s chamberlain who
weaves the intrigue from which Emilia escapes by death, are
powerfully drawn. Having completed <i>Emilia Galotti</i>, which the
younger generation of playwrights at once accepted as a model,
Lessing occupied himself for some years almost exclusively with
the treasures of the Wolfenbüttel library. The results of these
researches he embodied in a series of volumes, <i>Zur Geschichte und
Literatur</i>, the first being issued in 1773, the last in the year of
his death.</p>

<p>The last period of Lessing&rsquo;s life was devoted chiefly to theological
controversy. H. S. Reimarus (1694-1768), professor of
oriental languages in Hamburg, who commanded general respect
as a scholar and thinker, wrote a book entitled <i>Apologie oder
Schutzschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes</i>. His standpoint
was that of the English deists, and he investigated, without
hesitation, the evidence for the miracles recorded in the Bible.
The manuscript of this work was, after the author&rsquo;s death,
entrusted by his daughter to Lessing, who published extracts
from it in his <i>Zur Geschichte und Literatur</i> in 1774-1778. These
extracts, the authorship of which was not publicly avowed,
were known as the <i>Wolfenbütteler Fragmente</i>. They created
profound excitement among orthodox theologians, and evoked
many replies, in which Lessing was bitterly condemned for having
published writings of so dangerous a tendency. His most formidable
assailant was Johann Melchior Goeze (1717-1786),
the chief pastor of Hamburg, a sincere and earnest theologian,
but utterly unscrupulous in his choice of weapons against an
opponent. To him, therefore, Lessing addressed in 1778 his
most elaborate answers&mdash;<i>Eine Parabel</i>, <i>Axiomata</i>, eleven letters
with the title <i>Anti-Goeze</i>, and two pamphlets in reply to an
inquiry by Goeze as to what Lessing meant by Christianity.
These papers are not only full of thought and learning; they
are written with a grace, vivacity and energy that make them
hardly less interesting to-day than they were to Lessing&rsquo;s contemporaries.
He does not undertake to defend the conclusions
of Reimarus; his immediate object is to claim the right of free
criticism in regard even to the highest subjects of human thought.
The argument on which he chiefly relies is that the Bible cannot
be considered necessary to a belief in Christianity, since Christianity
was a living and conquering power before the New
Testament in its present form was recognized by the church. The
true evidence for what is essential in Christianity, he contends,
is its adaptation to the wants of human nature; hence the
religious spirit is undisturbed by the speculations of the boldest
thinkers. The effect of this controversy was to secure wider
freedom for writers on theology, and to suggest new problems
regarding the growth of Christianity, the formation of the canon
and the essence of religion. The Brunswick government having,
in deference to the consistory, confiscated the <i>Fragments</i> and
ordered Lessing to discontinue the controversy, he resolved, as
he wrote to Elise Reimarus, to try &ldquo;whether they would let
him preach undisturbed from his old pulpit, the stage.&rdquo; In
<i>Nathan der Weise</i>, written in the winter of 1778-1779, he gave
poetic form to the ideas which he had already developed in
prose. Its governing conception is that noble character may be
associated with the most diverse creeds, and that there can,
therefore, be no good reason why the holders of one sect of
religious principles should not tolerate those who maintain
wholly different doctrines. The play, which is written in blank
verse, is too obviously a continuation of Lessing&rsquo;s theological controversy
to rank high as poetry, but the representatives of the
three religions&mdash;the Mahommedan Saladin, the Jew Nathan and
the Christian Knight Templar&mdash;are finely conceived, and show
that Lessing&rsquo;s dramatic instinct had, in spite of other interests,
not deserted him. In 1780 appeared <i>Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts</i>,
the first half of which he had published in 1777 with
one of the <i>Fragments</i>. This work, composed a hundred brief
paragraphs, was the last, and is one of the most suggestive of
Lessing&rsquo;s writings. The doctrine on which its argument is
based is that no dogmatic creed can be regarded as final, but that
every historical religion had its share in the development of the
spiritual life of mankind. Lessing also maintains that history
reveals a definite law of progress, and that occasional retrogression
may be necessary for the advance of the world towards its
ultimate goal. These ideas formed a striking contrast to the
principles both of orthodox and of sceptical writers in Lessing&rsquo;s
day, and gave a wholly new direction to religious philosophy.
Another work of Lessing&rsquo;s last years, <i>Ernst und Falk</i> (a series of
five dialogues, of which the first three were published in 1777,
the last two in 1780), also set forth many new points of view.
Its nominal subject is freemasonry, but its real aim is to plead
for a humane and charitable spirit in opposition to a narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>499</span>
patriotism, an extravagant respect for rank, and exclusive
devotion to any particular church.</p>

<p>Lessing&rsquo;s theological opinions exposed him to much petty
persecution, and he was in almost constant straits for money.
Nothing, however, broke his manly and generous spirit. To
the end he was always ready to help those who appealed to him
for aid, and he devoted himself with growing ardour to the
search for truth. He formed many new plans of work, but in the
course of 1780 it became evident to his friends that he would not
be able much longer to continue his labours. His health had
been undermined by excessive work and anxiety, and after a short
illness he died at Brunswick on the 15th of February 1781.
&ldquo;We lose much in him,&rdquo; wrote Goethe after Lessing&rsquo;s death,
&ldquo;more than we think.&rdquo; It may be questioned whether there
is any other writer to whom the Germans owe a deeper debt of
gratitude. He was succeeded by poets and philosophers who
gave Germany for a time the first place in the intellectual life
of the world, and it was Lessing, as they themselves acknowledged,
who prepared the way for their achievements. Without attaching
himself to any particular system of philosophical doctrine, he
fought error incessantly, and in regard to art, poetry and the
drama and religion, suggested ideas which kindled the enthusiasm
of aspiring minds, and stimulated their highest energies.</p>

of the word is that of a portion of Scripture or other religious
writings appointed to be read at divine service, in accordance
with a table known as a &ldquo;lectionary.&rdquo; In the Church of England
the lectionary is so ordered that most of the Old Testament
is read through during the year as the First Lesson at Morning

New Testament, except Revelation, of which only portions are
read. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lection</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lectionary</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">L&rsquo;ESTRANGE, SIR ROGER<a name="ar205" id="ar205"></a></span> (1616-1704), English pamphleteer
on the royalist and court side during the Restoration epoch,
but principally remarkable as the first English man of letters
of any distinction who made journalism a profession, was born
at Hunstanton in Norfolk on the 17th of December 1616. In
1644, during the civil war, he headed a conspiracy to seize the
town of Lynn for the king, under circumstances which led to
his being condemned to death as a spy. The sentence, however,
was not executed, and after four years&rsquo; imprisonment in Newgate
he escaped to the Continent. He was excluded from the Act of
Indemnity, but in 1653 was pardoned by Cromwell upon his
personal solicitation, and lived quietly until the Restoration,
when after some delay his services and sufferings were acknowledged
by his appointment as licenser of the press. This office
was administered by him in the spirit which might be expected
from a zealous cavalier. He made himself notorious, not merely
by the severity of his literary censorship, but by his vigilance
in the suppression of clandestine printing. In 1663 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Newspapers</a></span>)
he commenced the publication of the <i>Public Intelligencer</i>
and the <i>News</i>, from which eventually developed the
famous official paper the <i>London Gazette</i> in 1665. In 1679 he
again became prominent with the <i>Observator</i>, a journal specially
designed to vindicate the court from the charge of a secret
inclination to popery. He discredited the Popish Plot, and
the suspicion he thus incurred was increased by the conversion
of his daughter to Roman Catholicism, but there seems no reason
to question the sincerity of his own attachment to the Church
of England. In 1687 he gave a further proof of independence
by discontinuing the <i>Observator</i> from his unwillingness to advocate
James II.&rsquo;s Edict of Toleration, although he had previously
gone all lengths in support of the measures of the court. The
Revolution cost him his office as licenser, and the remainder
of his life was spent in obscurity. He died in 1704. It is to
L&rsquo;Estrange&rsquo;s credit that among the agitations of a busy political
life he should have found time for much purely literary work
as a translator of Josephus, Cicero, Seneca, Quevedo and other
standard authors.</p>

She also wrote some powerful novels dealing with contemporary
life: <i>Le Mariage de Gabrielle</i> (1882); <i>Un Mystérieux Amour</i>

<i>Honneur d&rsquo;une femme</i> (1901); <i>La Force du passé</i> (1905). Her
poems were collected in 1895. She published in 1905 a book
on the economic status of women, <i>L&rsquo;Évolution féminine</i>; and in
1891-1893 a translation (2 vols.) of the works of Lord Byron,
which was awarded a prize by the Academy. Her <i>Masque

name, was produced at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt in 1905.
She received the ribbon of the Legion of Honour in 1900, and the

<p><span class="bold">LE SUEUR, EUSTACHE<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span> (1617-1655), one of the founders of
the French Academy of painting, was born on the 19th of
November 1617 at Paris, where he passed his whole life, and
where he died on the 30th of April 1655. His early death and
retired habits have combined to give an air of romance to his
simple history, which has been decorated with as many fables
as that of Claude. We are told that, persecuted by Le Brun,
who was jealous of his ability, he became the intimate friend and
correspondent of Poussin, and it is added that, broken-hearted at
the death of his wife, Le Sueur retired to the monastery of the
Chartreux and died in the arms of the prior. All this, however,
is pure fiction. The facts of Le Sueur&rsquo;s life are these. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>
the son of Cathelin Le Sueur, a turner and sculptor in wood,
who placed his son with Vouet, in whose studio he rapidly distinguished
himself. Admitted at an early age into the guild
of master-painters, he left them to take part in establishing the
academy of painting and sculpture, and was one of the first
twelve professors of that body. Some paintings, illustrative
of the Hypnerotomachia Polyphili, which were reproduced in
tapestry, brought him into notice, and his reputation was further
enhanced by a series of decorations (Louvre) in the mansion of
Lambert de Thorigny, which he left uncompleted, for their
execution was frequently interrupted by other commissions.
Amongst these were several pictures for the apartments of the
king and queen in the Louvre, which are now missing, although
they were entered in Bailly&rsquo;s inventory (1710); but several
works produced for minor patrons have come down to us. In
the gallery of the Louvre are the &ldquo;Angel and Hagar,&rdquo; from the
mansion of De Tonnay Charente; &ldquo;Tobias and Tobit,&rdquo; from the
Fieubet collection; several pictures executed for the church
of Saint Gervais; the &ldquo;Martyrdom of St Lawrence,&rdquo; from Saint
Germain de l&rsquo;Auxerrois; two very fine works from the destroyed
abbey of Marmoutiers; &ldquo;St Paul preaching at Ephesus,&rdquo; one
of Le Sueur&rsquo;s most complete and thorough performances, painted
for the goldsmith&rsquo;s corporation in 1649; and his famous series of
the &ldquo;Life of St Bruno,&rdquo; executed in the cloister of the Chartreux.
These last have more personal character than anything else
which Le Sueur produced, and much of their original beauty
survives in spite of injuries and restorations and removal from
the wall to canvas. The Louvre also possesses many fine drawings
(reproduced by Braun), of which Le Sueur left an incredible
quantity, chiefly executed in black and white chalk His pupils,
who aided him much in his work, were his wife&rsquo;s brother, Th.
Goussé, and three brothers of his own, as well as Claude Lefebvre
and Patel the landscape painter.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Most of his works have been engraved, chiefly by Picart, B.
Audran, Seb. Leclerc, Drevet, Chauveau, Poilly and Desplaces.
Le Sueur&rsquo;s work lent itself readily to the engraver&rsquo;s art, for he was a
charming draughtsman; he had a truly delicate perception of
varied shades of grave and elevated sentiment, and possessed the
power to render them. His graceful facility in composition was
always restrained by a very fine taste, but his works often fail to
please completely, because, producing so much, he had too frequent
recourse to conventional types, and partly because he rarely saw
colour except with the cold and clayey quality proper to the school
of Vouet; yet his &ldquo;St Paul at Ephesus&rdquo; and one or two other works
show that he was not naturally deficient in this sense, and whenever
we get direct reference to nature&mdash;as in the monks of the St Bruno
series&mdash;we recognize his admirable power to read and render physiognomy
of varied and serious type.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LESUEUR, JEAN FRANÇOIS<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span> (1760 or 1763-1837), French
musical composer, was born on the 15th of January 1760 (or
1763) at Drucat-Plessiel, near Abbeville. He was a choir boy
in the cathedral of Amiens, and then became musical director
at various churches. In 1786 he obtained by open competition
the musical directorship of the cathedral of Notre-Dame in
Paris, where he gave successful performances of sacred music
with a full orchestra. This place he resigned in 1787; and,
after a retirement of five years in a friend&rsquo;s country house, he
produced <i>La Caverne</i> and two other operas at the Théâtre
Feydeau in Paris. At the foundation of the Paris Conservatoire
(1795) Lesueur was appointed one of its inspectors of studies,
but was dismissed in 1802, owing to his disagreements with
Méhul. Lesueur succeeded G. Paisiello as <i>Maestro di cappella</i>
to Napoleon, and produced (1804) his <i>Ossian</i> at the Opéra. He
also composed for the emperor&rsquo;s coronation a mass and a Te
Deum. Louis XVIII., who had retained Lesueur in his court,
appointed him (1818) professor of composition at the Conservatoire;
and at this institution he had, among many other
pupils, Hector Berlioz, Ambroise Thomas, Louis Désiré, Besozzi
and Charles Gounod. He died on the 6th of October 1837. Lesueur
composed eight operas and several masses, and other sacred music.
All his works are written in a style of rigorous simplicity.</p>

born in Paris on the 19th of April 1603. Having entered the
public service he became maître des requêtes and in 1640
intendant of Piedmont; in 1643, owing to his friendship with
Mazarin, he became secretary of state for military affairs, being
an efficient administrator. In 1677 he was made chancellor of
France and he was one of those who influenced Louis XIV. to
revoke the Edict of Nantes. He died on the 30th of October
1685, a few days after the revocation had been signed. Le

statesman Louvois and another who became archbishop of Reims.

He was appointed provincial of his order in France, but it was
not until 1709 that he became the king&rsquo;s confessor. In this

It is also the name of a river in the infernal regions. Those
initiated in the mysteries were taught to distinguish two streams
in the lower world, one of memory and one of oblivion. Directions
for this purpose, written on a gold plate, have been found
in a tomb at Petilia, and near Lebadeia, at the oracle of Trophonius,
which was counted an entrance to the lower world, the
two springs Mnemosyne and Lethe were shown (Pausanias ix.

department of Seine-Inférieure, on the English Channel, at the
mouth of the Bresle, 114 m. N.N.W. of Paris on the Northern
railway. Pop. (1906) 4619. Owing to its nearness to the capital,
Le Tréport is a favourite watering-place of the Parisians. A
good view is obtained from Mont Huon, which rises to the south-west
of the town. The mouth of the Bresle forms a small port,
comprising an outer tidal harbour and an inner dock accessible
to vessels drawing from 13 to 16 ft. The fisheries and oyster
parks with their dependent industries, shipbuilding and glass
manufacture, furnish the chief occupations of the inhabitants.
Coal, timber, ice and jute are imported; <i>articles de Paris</i>, sugar,
&amp;c., are exported. The chief buildings are the church of St
Jacques (16th century), which has finely carved vaulting and
good modern stained glass, and the casino erected 1896-1897.
About 1 m. north-east of Le Tréport is the small bathing resort
of Mers. The Eu-Tréport canal, uniting the two towns, has a
length of about 3 m., and is navigable by vessels drawing 14 ft.
Le Tréport (the ancient <i>Ulterior Portus</i>) was a port of some note
in the middle ages and suffered from the English invasions.
Louis Philippe twice received Queen Victoria here.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LETRONNE, JEAN ANTOINE<a name="ar214" id="ar214"></a></span> (1787-1848), French archaeologist,
was born at Paris on the 25th of January 1787. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>501</span>
father, a poor engraver, sent him to study art under the painter
David, but his own tastes were literary, and he became a student
in the Collège de France, where it is said he used to exercise his
already strongly developed critical faculty by correcting for his
own amusement old and bad texts of Greek authors, afterwards
comparing the results with the latest and most approved editions.
From 1810 to 1812 he travelled in France, Switzerland and
Italy, and on his return to Paris published an <i>Essai critique sur
la topographie de Syracuse</i> (1812), designed to elucidate Thucydides.
Two years later appeared his <i>Recherches géographiques et
critiques on the De Mensura Orbis Terrae</i> of Dicuil. In 1815 he
was commissioned by government to complete the translation of
Strabo which had been begun by Laporte-Dutheil, and in March
1816 he was one of those who were admitted to the Academy
of Inscriptions by royal ordinance, having previously contributed
a <i>Mémoire</i>, &ldquo;On the Metrical System of the Egyptians,&rdquo; which
had been crowned. Further promotion came rapidly; in 1817
he was appointed director of the École des Chartes, in 1819
inspector-general of the university, and in 1831 professor of
history in the Collège de France. This chair he exchanged in
1838 for that of archaeology, and in 1840 he succeeded Pierre C.
François Daunou (1761-1840) as keeper of the national archives.
Meanwhile he had published, among other works, <i>Considérations
générales sur l&rsquo;évaluation des monnaies grecques et romaines et sur
la valeur de l&rsquo;or et de l&rsquo;argent avant la découverte de l&rsquo;Amérique</i>
(1817), <i>Recherches pour servir à l&rsquo;histoire d&rsquo;Égypte pendant la
domination des Grecs et des Romains</i> (1823), and <i>Sur l&rsquo;origine
grecque des zodiaques prétendus égyptiens</i> (1837). By the last-named
he finally exploded a fallacy which had up to that time
vitiated the chronology of contemporary Egyptologists. His
<i>Diplômes et Chartres de l&rsquo;époque Mérovingienne sur papyrus et
sur vélin</i> were published in 1844. The most important work of
Letronne is the <i>Recueil des inscriptions grecques et latines de
l&rsquo;Égypte</i>, of which the first volume appeared in 1842, and the
second in 1848. He died at Paris on the 14th of December 1848.</p>
